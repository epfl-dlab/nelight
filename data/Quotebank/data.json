The International Monetary Fund and Greece estimate that Athens will need 10-11 billion euros in new financing in 2014 - 2015 above what the euro zone and the International Monetary Fund have agreed to so far . This is partly because euro zone central banks refused to delay repayment of Greek government bonds , contrary to an assumption by euro zone finance ministers , the Eurogroup , when they set up the current bailout . Greece is still deep in its worst post-war slump , and the sale of state assets is well behind plan . Greece has already had two international bailouts since 2010 , and more money for it is controversial in Germany which has elections on September 22 . Voters there are tired of helping others after three years of the sovereign debt crisis . Greece will not need any additional funds until the second half of 2014 , but a decision must be taken in November at the latest because the IMF can only participate in the Greek bailout if the program is fully funded 12 months ahead . `` As far as the potential need for a third program for Greece is concerned , it 's clear that despite recent progress , Greece 's troubles will not have been completely resolved by 2014 , '' Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem told the European Parliament on Thursday . `` It is realistic to assume that additional support will be needed beyond the program . In this context , the Eurogroup has indicated clearly that it is committed to providing adequate support to Greece during the current program and beyond until it has regained market access , '' he said . Dijsselbloem also said Ireland would receive euro zone help to get out of its bailout program at the end of this year , news that may displease some voters in Germany [ ID : nB5N0GL00B ] The next review of the reforms that Greece has committed to in exchange for the 172 billion euro financial lifeline last year , will start in late September and take several weeks to complete . It is written by inspectors from the IMF , the European Central Bank and the European Commission - called the troika . `` Once this is completed , we will have an overview ... of the financing of the current program and we will have this on our agenda the next month and finalize the process in November , '' Dijsselbloem said . He declined to confirm that the missing funding for Greece would be in the form of new loans , but the euro zone seems to have little choice . A senior EU official said that other options included an early return to markets by Greece with a short-term bond and re-assigning unused bailout funds earmarked for the recapitalization of the Greek banking sector . DEBT RELIEF ? Yet the IMF believes the euro zone will have to go even further than new financing , by providing some form of debt relief to Greece , whose ratio of debt to economic output is to peak at 175-176 percent this year . In July , the IMF estimated that Athens will also need a debt reduction of some 4 percent of gross domestic product in 2014-2015 if the country is to meet its goal of cutting the debt pile to 124 percent in 2020 and well below 110 percent in 2022 . Euro zone finance ministers are ready to discuss some help on debt for Greece after April 2014 , when the EU publishes official debt and deficit data for 2013 , providing Greece meets all its reform targets . The ministers agreed last December however , that such relief would be limited to cutting the interest on the 53 billion euros of bilateral loans extended under the first bailout as well as further reducing the amounts that Greece has to contribute to European Union-funded projects in the country . But the interest reduction on the bilateral loans would yield only very small amounts . `` Greece pays interest of 3-month EURIBOR of 0.22-0 .23 percent , plus a 0.5 point margin . If you take that margin away , that 's how much Greece can get - that 's 265 million euros , '' one euro zone official involved in the discussions said . Greek debt now stands at around 305 billion euros , or 160 percent of GDP . Most of that Athens owes to the euro zone . Yet the euro zone is not prepared simply to forgive Greece some of the debt . `` There will be no haircut to the nominal value of the loans , it will not happen , '' a second euro zone official involved in the Greek talks said . `` I can not see it happening , it is politically impossible to imagine . If loans were to be turned into grants , it would so fundamentally change the nature of the Greek support program , that I do not see any readiness to do that , '' the official said . The official added that if Greece were forgiven debt , other euro zone countries like Ireland , Portugal or Spain which received euro zone support could demand the same .

'' to achieve this it has again turned to the apple 101 business textbook . it is rolling out the eprint platform across a variety of platforms including ios , android and blackberry , in a bid to connect consumers with the growing install base of eprint enabled printers ( this currently broke the 10million milestone according to apac ipg vp john solomon ) . it is hoping this ecosystem is attractive for app developers to invent creative new ways for people to use the humble printer . `` apple has attracted all the users and it becomes attractive to developers to build on that platform , '' mr nigro said . `` that 's exactly what we 're doing and we want to create new use cases for the printer . we 're very similar in that way . '' indeed , at the recent innovation for impact event in shanghai the slogan repeatedly chanted by the company 's ipg chief , vyomesh joshi , was that hp is allowing atoms to be converted to bits and then back to atoms again . the talk is extremely bold considering the company is still digesting the giant humble pie served up when it abruptly axed the touchpad and webos mobile computing operating system . this came just weeks after the highly-celebrated device was launched with much fanfare as the champion of its tablet and mobile ambitions . this may be the reason that hp execs were extremely keen to play down the likeness with apple 's disruptive effects , despite the obvious similarities . this time could be different for hp . instead of heading out into uncharted waters ( tablet ) it is playing in a market it already dominates ( it has market share of 50 per cent of inkjet printers in australia , an all-time high , according to local hp printer chief richard bailey ) . it is simply building cloud services on top of this to connect existing users and properties . most importantly , hp is playing to win . `` this is a winner takes all game , '' mr nigro said . `` apple has all the momentum and it 's hard for competitors to catch up .

Written , directed and performered by Sean Lionadh , the viral film - which has so far racked up more than half a million views - is a timely riposte to expectations of conformity placed on LGBT + people . Despite being well-received online , the film has caused some controversy ; one excerpt in particular has Scottish Catholic Church leaders all fired up . The scenes in question refer to `` Bible bashers '' with cardboard placards which `` taste like cardboard and smell like hate '' . In a letter sent to BBC Scotland director Donalda Mackinnon , Bishop of Paisley John Keenan wrote : When it comes to important public debates about the wellbeing of the human person and the truth and meaning of human sexuality , Catholics feel their views are becoming increasingly marginalised , almost criminalised . BBC Scotland defended its decision to share the film , highlighting that ` The Social ' is a platform created solely to spotlight the work of young creators . The film was described as a `` personal polemic '' whose views on Catholicism reflected the views of its creator , not BBC Scotland more generally : As a young gay man raised in the Catholic faith , it is seen through his eyes and told in his voice . It is intended to reflect the challenges and opinions he personally faced while growing up in Scotland . The statement did , however , state that BBC Scotland regrets that some church members were offended by the film . As such , Mackinnon has agreed to a meeting in which the subject will be discussed further .

Canada 's version was a light blue denim jean jacket , formerly owned by the late goalie Chris Sanderson . Dillon Ward , playing in his first-ever Federation of International Lacrosse ( FIL ) World Championship , wore it off the field and into the locker room , after being named tournament MVP with a 63.3 save percentage , capped by a 10-stop performance in Canada 's 8-5 win over the U.S. in the gold medal game Saturday night . `` It 's Chris Sanderson 's , ' Ward said with a beaming simile , wearing the tightly fitting garment while walking in the room . Intangibles were all over the place for Canada at this year 's world championship . The memories of Sanderson and Erik Miller , two former goalies who passed away within the last three years from cancer , since playing for Team Canada in 2010 , were on the forefront of everyone 's minds , and the front and back of their practice pennies . They wore reversible red-and-whites with Sanderson 's jersey No. 17 on the front and Miller 's No. 35 on the back , an idea hatched by Team Canada general manager Dave Huntley . Canada head coach Randy Mearns kept his No. 51 warm-up shirt - honoring Tucker Williams , the son of NLL star Shawn Williams of the Buffalo Bandits who is currently undergoing treatment for Burkitt 's Lymphoma - on throughout the game . ( Scott McCall ) Sanderson 's wife sent the jean jacket to one of the team 's four captains , Brodie Merrill , the now three-time All-World defenseman , to have it handed out after every game of the tournament . Members of the Canada coaching staff came out for warmups at Dick 's Sporting Goods Park wearing jerseys with the No. 51 on the back , to honor another Canadian , Tucker Williams , the eight-year-old son of Buffalo Bandits player Shawn Williams . Tucker has Burkitt 's lymphoma , which had been in remission but returned about a month ago , and Mearns said afterward the team plans to present the jerseys to the Williams family . Canada also won despite injury issues . Regular starting defenseman Jason Noble ( high ankle sprain ) did n't play at all in the final after missing most of Canada 's 12-6 win over the Iroquois Nationals in the semifinal . Attackman Curtis Dickson , after a pair of hard hits , left the game for good early in the second half , favoring his arm and bounded up and down the sideline with nervous energy as time ticked away in the fourth quarter . `` We just had to stay to the game plan , '' Canada coach Randy Mearns said . '' [ Faceoff man ] Geoff Snider and our wing play off the faceoffs was phenomenal . It was 18-8 for us on ground balls in the first half . When we needed to get the ball , our guys were getting the ball . We had a lot of heart . We played Canadian lacrosse , tough-nosed , get the ball and grind it out . '' Canada learned John Grant Jr. was withdrawing from competition a week before opening ceremonies so they scrambled to adjust early on in the games . After the 10-7 opening loss to Team USA , they shuffled the deck and moved Jeremy Noble to attack . Midfielder Kevin Crowley , largely quiet throughout the tournament with three goals heading into Saturday , scored five in the final , as many as the U.S. did as a team . `` The big cat came purring today , '' Mearns said of Crowley , the reigning Major League Lacrosse MVP who was dealt from the Florida Launch to the Chesapeake Bayhawks early in the tournament . `` That was beautiful . He was a presence . It 's every little piece . We went and said , ` What 's a team that can go win a gold medal and be considered the best team ever ? ' You start looking at all these little pieces and you need to juggle it . `` The picture is still the same but all of sudden John Grant Jr. is going to withdraw so we need to figure that out , '' Mearns said . `` Championship game , Curtis Dickson , halfway through , he 's out . Jason Noble with the ankle sprain . Now we 're down to five poles . He was gamer . He was ready to go in . It 's all those things . When it comes together , you feel like the old-school A-team . When a plan comes together , and it did . It 's Saturday , July 19 and we 're world champions . '' This is n't to say the U.S. did n't have its intangibles as well . Right before the game , the U.S. staff adhered an Army flag to a shaft , to create the fifth of five flags the team would carry out onto the field for the championship game . There had been military tones with the U.S. throughout the year-plus tryout process and during the tournament under former Navy head coach Richie Meade . `` Awesome , '' Meade said pregame , looking at the Army flag . Team USA faceoff men Chris Eck and Greg Gurenlian , owners of the team 's US Award after the semifinal win against Australia , carried the stars and bars out in front , as had been custom for the team throughout the tournament , followed by Garrett Thul , who will start more Army training in Fort Benning , Ga. . In a few weeks , carrying the Army flag , Mitch Belisle carrying a Navy flag , Max Seibald with a Marines flag and Ned Crotty with an Air Force banner . It was a player-driven order and representation . The U.S. Men 's players came out with the American flag as well as one from each of the four branches of the military before the contest against Canada . ( Scott McCall ) `` It 's like everything else : We have a mission to do , and we 're a day away from it , '' Meade said at Team USA 's final practice before the gold medal game on early Friday evening at the University of Denver . `` It 's a two-year process . There 's a lot on the line . We want to be at our best [ Saturday ] night . That 's what the whole thing has been about . '' Mearns agreed and said Canada ended up finding itself throughout the tournament . Many Canadian players said after the opening night loss to the U.S. that the group was just starting to find its identity , and said they would be better next time around . On the eve of the tournament opener , Canada defensive coordinator Taylor Wray worked on installing zone defense schemes , but they did n't use them ten days ago as much as they did in Saturday 's final , forcing outside shots from U.S. midfielders that often missed the mark or were controlled by Ward , the 6-foot-5 netminder who wore a shorter man 's jacket after collecting a gold medal . Ward also came up with big second-half stops , most notably on a Paul Rabil chance from the wing created off a hard ride by the U.S. , and it attempted to rally . & copy2014 Copyright US Lacrosse , Inc. 113 West University Parkway | Baltimore , MD 21210", "date": "2014-07-20 04:00:00", "url": "http://laxmagazine.com/international/men/2013-14/news/072014_talismans_for_gold_medal_game_include_jean_jacket_and_flags", "phase": "E", "title": "Jean Jackets , Flags and Other FIL Final Talismans - US Lacrosse", "names": [{"name": "chris sanderson", "ids": ["Q5107980"], "offsets": [[54, 56], [120, 122], [161, 162], [212, 213], [286, 287], [947, 948]]}, {"name": "dillon ward", "ids": ["Q18159083"], "offsets": [[57, 59], [125, 126], [1263, 1264], [1281, 1282]]}, {"name": "erik miller", "ids": ["Q44194572"], "offsets": [[163, 165], [221, 222]]}, {"name": "randy mearns", "ids": ["Q7292315"], "offsets": [[243, 245], [386, 387], [500, 502], [658, 659], [769, 770], [1163, 1164]]}, {"name": "shawn williams", "ids": ["Q13064143", "Q58372240", "Q7491485"], "offsets": [[254, 255], [261, 263], [355, 356], [364, 366], [398, 399]]}, {"name": "brodie merrill", "ids": ["Q4973031"], "offsets": [[302, 304]]}, {"name": "jeremy noble", "ids": ["Q6181732"], "offsets": [[412, 413], [612, 614], [787, 788]]}, {"name": "curtis dickson", "ids": ["Q5195723"], "offsets": [[443, 445], [776, 778]]}, {"name": "geoff snider", "ids": ["Q5534322"], "offsets": [[509, 511]]}, {"name": "john grant", "ids": ["Q10387563", "Q15993028", "Q17660594", "Q2020790", "Q21165830", "Q22104337", "Q2892823", "Q3181632", "Q43912880", "Q6236014", "Q6236019", "Q6236025", "Q6236031", "Q6236036", "Q6236037"], "offsets": [[574, 576], [753, 755]]}, {"name": "kevin crowley", "ids": ["Q6396091"], "offsets": [[618, 620], [661, 662]]}, {"name": "richie meade", "ids": ["Q7330537"], "offsets": [[926, 928], [933, 934], [1102, 1103]]}, {"name": "greg gurenlian", "ids": ["Q20727714"], "offsets": [[950, 952]]}, {"name": "mitch belisle", "ids": ["Q6880800"], "offsets": [[1014, 1016]]}, {"name": "max seibald", "ids": ["Q16980758"], "offsets": [[1021, 1023]]}, {"name": "ned crotty", "ids": ["Q16205185"], "offsets": [[1028, 1030]]}, {"name": "taylor wray", "ids": ["Q7690187"], "offsets": [[1220, 1222]]}, {"name": "paul rabil", "ids": ["Q7153074"], "offsets": [[1294, 1296]]}]}, {"articleID": "2012082605_00043941_W", "content": "oakland , calif. -- one by one , they hobbled to the sideline with some body part in a state of disrepair . first it was a shoulder , then a hand , then an ankle , then another . for the lions , saturday 's third exhibition game - usually a chance for starters to get their most extensive work before regular-season games begin - could hardly have been more painful . matthew stafford suffered an injury to his left ( non-throwing ) hand in the second quarter , starting cornerbacks bill bentley and chris houston left with shoulder and ankle injuries , respectively , and on the day mikel leshoure made his lions debut , running back kevin smith limped off the field with a bum ankle in a 31-20 loss to the raiders . lions coach jim schwartz said in a halftime interview with wxyz-tv that stafford 's hand appeared to ok . but stafford spent a good chunk of the first half on the sideline with his hand wrapped in ice and covered by a towel . when he walked off the field at halftime , he had black tape or a small brace on his hand . `` he got his hand banged , '' schwartz told wxyz . `` we 'll see . i think he 's ok .

Macron and far-right populist Marine Le Pen advanced Sunday to a runoff in France 's presidential election , remaking the country 's political system and setting up a showdown over its participation in the European Union . ( AP Photo/Christophe Ena ) PARIS -- French voters shut out the political mainstream from the presidency for the first time in modern history , and on Monday found themselves being courted for the runoff election between populist Marine Le Pen and centrist Emmanuel Macron . French politicians on the moderate left and right , including the Socialist and Republicans party losers in Sunday 's vote , immediately urged voters to block Le Pen 's path to power in the May 7 contest . Voters narrowed the presidential field from 11 to two . Both that vote and the May 7 runoff are widely seen as a litmus test for the populist wave that last year prompted Britain to vote to leave the European Union and America to elect Donald Trump president . The defeated far-left candidate , Jean-Luc Melenchon , pointedly refused to back Macron , and Le Pen 's National Front is hoping to do the once unthinkable and peel away voters historically opposed to a party long tainted by racism and anti-Semitism . `` The voters who voted for Mr. Melenchon are angry voters . They can be in agreement with us , '' Steeve Brios , a vice-president of Le Pen 's National Front party , told The Associated Press . He said they express a choice `` outside the system . '' Choosing from inside the system is no longer an option . Voters rejected the two mainstream parties that have alternated power for decades , in favour of Le Pen and the untested Macron , who has never held elected office and who founded his own political movement just last year . Turnout was 78 per cent , down slightly from 79 per cent in the first round of presidential voting in 2012 . Socialist candidate Benoit Hamon , whose party holds a majority in the legislature , got just 6 per cent . Socialist President Francois Hollande is the most unpopular in modern French record-keeping . He did not seek re-election . `` We are in a phase of decomposition , demolition , deconstruction , '' said former Socialist prime minister Manuel Valls . `` We did n't do the work -- intellectual , ideological and political -- on what the left is , and we paid the price . '' Francois Fillon , the scandal-plagued conservative Republicans candidate , fared marginally better , coming in third with just shy of 20 per cent of the vote . Both centre-right and centre-left fell in behind Macron , whose optimistic vision of a tolerant France and a united Europe with open borders is a stark contrast to Le Pen 's darker , inward-looking `` French-first '' platform that calls for closed borders , tougher security , less immigration and dropping the shared euro currency to return to the French franc . Le Pen on Monday called her opponent `` weak '' against Islamic terrorism . European stock markets surged as investors welcomed the first-round results , with Macron favoured to win . German Chancellor Angela Merkel wished Macron `` all the best for the next two weeks . '' Merkel 's chief of staff , Peter Altmaier , tweeted that `` the result for Emmanuel Macron shows : France AND Europe can win together ! The centre is stronger than the populists think ! '' Le Pen 's father , Jean-Marie , made it to the second round against Jacques Chirac in 2002 and was crushed in the runoff . Many commentators expect the same fate for his daughter , but she has already drawn far more support than he ever did and she has transformed the party 's once-pariah image . Chirac refused to debate Jean-Marie Le Pen on principle ; Macron has already agreed to share a stage with his daughter . Le Pen offers an alternative for anyone skeptical of the European Union and France 's role in it , said Louis Aliot , the vice-president of the National Front party . `` I 'm not convinced that the French are willing to sign a blank check to Mr. Macron , '' he said . But Macron 's party spokesman , Benjamin Griveaux , said the far-right candidate is hardly a vector of change . `` She 's been in the political system for 30 years . She inherited her father 's party and we will undoubtedly have Le Pens running for the next 20 years , because after we had the father , we have the daughter and we will doubtless have the niece , '' he said . `` So she is in a truly bad position to be talking about the elites and the people . '' Macron came in first in Sunday 's vote , with just over 23 per cent ; Le Pen had 21 per cent ; Melenchon and Fillon each had 19 per cent . Fillon , a former prime minister , bested the former Trotskyist Melenchon by just 94,998 votes . Protesters overnight burned cars , danced around bonfires and dodged riot police at the Place de la Bastille and Republique . Twenty-nine people were detained at the Bastille , where protesters waved red flags and sang `` No Marine and No Macron ! '' in anger at the results . ___ Ganley reported from Henin-Beaumont .

Former maths teacher Dave Wharton died of cancer in March this year and 22 female teachers have decided to run the five kilometre course to raise funds to combat the illness . Jo Farrall , 53 , a member of the school 's pastoral support team , said : `` The school is a close community and it can only affect you when something like that happens . `` None of us have ever done the Pretty Muddy before . A few of us had done Race for Life but this is a new one on all of us . `` We expect that we are going to get very muddy . There are some quite fit ladies among us and there are those like myself that are not at the peak of fitness . `` We are going to give it a good go and we expect it is going to be a good laugh . We have a really good team so it is also a nice thing to do to get us all together . `` Most people are affected by cancer at some point in their lives . It is one that touches most of us and most will have lost someone who struggled with cancer . `` One of our students has cancer as well and so it just makes it that little bit more relevant . '' Talking about Mr Wharton , Ms Farrell said : `` We all knew him and worked alongside him and were friends with him .

The impact of the strike could be seen across all major markets in Delhi like South Extension , Defence Colony , Connaught Place , Karol Bagh , Rajouri Garden , Khan Market , Chandni Chowk and Kamla Nagar . Shoppers who had come to these markets ended up having to return empty handed as they were caught unaware about the strike . In several markets , these shoppers were seen stranded in the early afternoon drizzle as they did not even have open shops to take shelter in . However , some markets in east Delhi were seen functioning normally in the evening . Traders claimed the strike resulted in losses for them amounting to nearly \u20b9 1,500 crore , along with a \u20b9 125-crore loss for the government ( in the form of taxes ) . The Confederation of All India Traders ( CAIT ) , which issued the call for the strike , warned it would protest again if no concrete measures are taken by the Centre by next week . `` Just one day ( of the bandh ) has affected lives of 20 lakh people , who could n't work . And if the situation ( sealing drives ) continues , then it will hurt both the traders and the governments , '' said Praveen Khandelwal , secretary-general , CAIT . According to Khandelwal , over 2,000 traders ' associations had shut their outlets in markets across Delhi . Traders ' associations are likely to hold another meeting in two days to decide the next course of action against the ongoing sealing drive . The sealing drive started in Delhi from December 22 , with Supreme Court-appointed and recently revived monitoring committee taking action against commercial establishments for non-payment of ` use conversion charge ' and for the alleged violation of civic norms such as misuse of properties , and illegal constructions . Traders also held protest march at South Extension , Chowk Hauz Qazi , Kamla Nagar , Rajouri Garden and Krishna Nagar markets . In South Extension I , the jewellery shops , branded outlets and garments shops remained closed . However , in all markets , few chemist shops , eateries and food outlets were seen functioning . Besides prominent markets , wholesale and commercial markets such as Chandni Chowk , Sadar Bazar , Chawri Bazar , Kamla Nagar , Karol Bagh , Kashmere Gate , Khari Baoil , Naya Bazar , Bhagirath Palace , Paharganj , Rajouri Garden , remained shut and wore a deserted look as well . Earlier in the day , many areas were also closed due to the Republic Day full-dress rehearsal . In west Delhi 's Rajouri Garden too , the streets were desolate . However , some shopkeepers had opened the shutters of their shops half-way , ready to pull them down if traders association arrived . Similarly , commercial activity had come to a standstill in Karol Bagh market . `` Street vendors too refrained from selling their stock . Customers who had come to the market hoping to do some shopping had to return empty-handed or run for cover in front of closed shops due to rain , '' said Manoj Gupta , who visited the market with his family on Tuesday morning . At Khan Market , however , traders observed a partial bandh as the shops and restaurants started operation from 2pm . `` We shut our establishments till 2pm as a show of solidarity against the high handedness and sealing without application of mind , '' said Anshu Tandon , president of Khan Market Restaurants Association . Vikram Badhwar , secretary of New Delhi Traders Association , said even Connaught Place , which is a commercial area , is under the SC-appointed monitoring committee 's scanner . `` They have written to the New Delhi Municipal Council regarding CP , too . Council 's officials have been on recce to check basements and roofs . How can they ( monitoring committee ) exploit traders like this ? They think they are above law . We protest this unjustified action on shops and restaurants across the city , '' Badhwar said . At CP , most restaurants and shops were shut for the day . Many shoppers appeared clueless regarding the reason behind the closed shops . `` I came with my friends to get a suit stitched . However , I was not aware of this strike . Now I have to come back again later , '' said Rajesh Jain , a 30-year-old Dilshad Garden resident .", "date": "2018-01-23 23:14:05", "url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/thousands-of-shops-shut-as-traders-strike-against-sealing-in-delhi-markets/story-Vk90OwJL4OjKDXs80CK5WI.html", "phase": "E", "title": "Thousands of shops shut as traders strike against sealing in Delhi markets", "names": [{"name": "manoj gupta", "ids": ["Q16196967", "Q45356493"], "offsets": [[680, 682]]}]}, {"articleID": "2011011010_00008157_W", "content": "published on mon jan 10 08:37:19 gmt 2011 a round up of news in brief from across lancashire violent crime in city suburb more than 20 crimes were committed in a preston suburb in one month . the broadgate pact ( police and community together ) reported there were 26 crimes in the ward , from november 3 to december 8 . among them was one robbery , two burglaries , six of damage , 10 thefts , two violent crimes , two car crimes and three classed as other . neighbours to discuss issues have your say on issues which affect your neighbourhood . people who live in ingol and tanterton are invited to attend the next pact meeting to discuss issues in the neighbourhood , including antisocial behaviour and underage drinking . it will take place at st margaret 's church , in ingol , on wednesday february 2 at 6pm . stroll out for healthy walk get some fresh air and exercise at an organised health walk . the walk will start from the green flag at worden park , in leyland , on thursday january 27 , at 1pm . for more information on the walk or any other similar event call 01772 421491 or email info@southribble.gov.uk . home care can affect quality of life the quality of the care elderly people receive in lancashire has come under the spotlight in a new report released by a health care watchdog . while the report called ` who is looking after uncle albert ?

Transportation Spokesman Michael Arthur C. Sagcal said the two firms ' qualification documents passed the evaluation conducted by the agency 's bids and awards committee . `` Our bids and awards committee will now proceed to the opening and evaluation of technical proposals , '' he said . Out of a dozen potential investors that expressed their interest in the project , only Filinvest and Megawide joined the long-delayed auction , submitting their offers before the agency last month . The two groups last year fought over the P17.5-billion Mactan-Cebu International Airport Expansion deal , with one party accusing another of illegally bidding for the said project . The airport contract was then awarded to top bidder GMR-Megawide Cebu Airport Corp. , which is now operating and maintaining the aviation hub in Cebu . After battling for the airport deal , the two camps will now wage war for the contract to build an intermodal terminal near the Manila-Cavite Toll Expressway ( Cavitex ) to connect passengers coming from Cavite to urban transport systems in Metro Manila . It will include a passenger terminal building , arrival and departure bays , public information systems , ticketing and baggage handling facilities and park-ride facilities .

And the crowded GOP field now includes 11 candidates , while Democrats have four hopefuls in the race . For Republicans especially , the pressure is on to make the most of their nascent campaigns to make it into the first presidential debate , which is a mere 52 days away on Aug. 6 in Cleveland . `` Everyone 's starting their engines and deciding they 're going to have to make this push now , '' said national GOP strategist Ford O'Connell . There has been little drama this cycle with the will-they-or-won ` t-they game . Virtually everyone who has been toying with a White House run has pulled the trigger . Only Govs. Scott Walker , Wisconsin ; Chris Christie , New Jersey ; Bobby Jindal , Louisiana ; and John Kasich , Ohio , are left . Walker is reportedly eyeing an official announcement the second week of July , after his state 's budget deadline , while Jindal is set to announce next June 24 . Christie continues to give signs that he is getting in , while Kasich has started to build a team in the early states and hired top-name consultants . Some of the candidates who got in early have all gotten bounces . Texas Sen. Ted Cruz , who announced nearly three months ago , saw his stock rise , especially in Iowa , while Florida Sen. Marco Rubio saw a marked uptick in early states and nationally . Meanwhile , despite good reviews , other candidates - including former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina , South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Texas Gov. Rick Perry - are still lagging in the polls and face the real threat of being left off the first debate stage . Fox News has decided they are limiting the event to the top 10 candidates in an average of the most recent national polls , though last week they bowed to pressure and will host a forum earlier that day for candidates who do n't make the cut . Monday , all eyes were on Bush , as he officially launched his presidential campaign . Though he was one of the first to confirm in December he was `` actively exploring '' a bid - and he has so many establishment advantages of money and organization - his unofficial campaigning over the past few months has been unable to put any space between him and the rest of the field . He hopes his official campaign announcement can be something of a reset . `` I will take nothing and no one for granted , '' he said Monday in Miami at his kickoff . `` I will run with heart . I will run to win . '' While the past two nominating cycles have seen the GOP establishment favorite eventually take the nomination , strategists warn that this cycle there 's now no clear front-runner . `` He 's the one with the hardest task , '' said Ford O'Connell , who worked for the Arizona senator 's 2008 campaign . `` Unlike previous establishment folks like [ John ] McCain and [ Mitt ] Romney , the one thing he faces they did n't is a very challenging field . '' After missteps and concern from conservatives over his positions on immigration reform and Common Core educational standards , Bush is near the top of the pack Iowa . Another big question will be answered on Tuesday - what will Donald Trump do ? After flirting with presidential runs for years - and trying to psych out the press - the reality TV star and business mogul keeps talking like he 's really taking the plunge this year . If that does happen , he could push other candidates off the debate stage , too , since he 's currently polling ninth nationally . The field could see another aftershock if Kasich does jump in . But the Ohio governor could face the curse of other candidates who have waited too long to officially announce - Perry waited until August 2011 last time and never gained traction , while in 2008 , then-Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson 's long-awaited candidacy flopped . `` A lot of people do n't understand that running for president looks real easy from the cheap seats but it 's a lot different from the ground , '' said O'Connell .", "date": "2015-06-15 20:42:04", "url": "http://wesm913.org/post/race-president-really-begins-week", "phase": "E", "title": "The Race For President Really Begins This Week | WESM", "names": [{"name": "ford o'connell", "ids": ["Q5467883"], "offsets": [[100, 102], [523, 525], [758, 759]]}, {"name": "scott walker", "ids": ["Q13502385", "Q2035840", "Q20712628", "Q28835721", "Q48799183", "Q488603", "Q553254", "Q55362601", "Q7437461"], "offsets": [[135, 137], [160, 161]]}, {"name": "chris christie", "ids": ["Q63879"], "offsets": [[140, 142], [190, 191]]}, {"name": "bobby jindal", "ids": ["Q295492"], "offsets": [[146, 148], [181, 182]]}, {"name": "john kasich", "ids": ["Q69319"], "offsets": [[152, 154], [202, 203], [543, 544], [677, 678]]}, {"name": "ted cruz", "ids": ["Q2036942"], "offsets": [[233, 235]]}, {"name": "marco rubio", "ids": ["Q324546"], "offsets": [[255, 257]]}, {"name": "carly fiorina", "ids": ["Q256380"], "offsets": [[280, 282]]}, {"name": "lindsey graham", "ids": ["Q22212"], "offsets": [[286, 288]]}, {"name": "rick perry", "ids": ["Q215057"], "offsets": [[291, 293], [702, 703]]}, {"name": "donald trump", "ids": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"], "offsets": [[606, 608]]}, {"name": "fred thompson", "ids": ["Q298016"], "offsets": [[720, 722]]}]}, {"articleID": "2014090506_00012354_W", "content": "Maxi Yacht Rolex Cup 2014 - Managing Excellence - Bowmen calling the start .

Communication with the competitors begins each morning with a radio announcement at 09:30 . Ahead of this , Craig works with the YCCS Race Management team , analysing up to five professional weather forecasts . This information helps determine location and length of the day 's racecourses . The team will also canvas the opinion of the professional navigators onsite , weathermen in their own right . `` When people ask me what a good race is , I 'll tell them in one word : fair , '' explains Craig . `` If you are a sailor , or former sailor like in my case , you have a good sense of what the owners want , you 've been there on the boat with them , you know what they are looking for . '' According to Craig , making good decisions is not a one person job , he 's only as good as the people around him , and the YCCS team is highly respected by the competitors . `` The yacht club is high end in terms of race management , they 're on top of everything , very professional . They have been here for a long time , they know the environment and conditions , '' confirms Butterworth , tactician on Sir Peter Ogden 's Mini Maxi Jethou . Clean start To the untrained eye , the starting area on the Maxi Yacht Rolex Cup can appear confused . Watching 35 yachts ranging from 60 to 143-ft hoisting sails , running through last minute preparations , ensuring they make the right choice about where and when to cross the start line is nerve-jangling . There is order ; each class has its own individual start time , its own sequence of instructions to follow . `` As it gets closer to the first gun the boats not involved in that start will clear out and give appropriate room to the starting class , '' explains Craig . `` We 're looking for people to behave themselves , you will hear us on the radio if they are not . '' One of the key factors at the start is ensuring no boat crosses the line too early . When competitors are timing their arrival by split seconds , seeking small but significant advantages , it 's a critical , but difficult task for the race officers . `` These boats have the latest technology , the very best sailors , so they are not two or three boat lengths beyond but a matter of metres . If they have started early and must double-back , we have to make that call . '' The Race Committee has boats stationed at both ends of the start line to ensure an optimum view . Adapting to conditions Once a race has started , the focus changes to ensuring the racing remains fair on the water . Planning commences beforehand . `` We look at the VPPs ( speed predictions ) for each of the boats in each of classes , because they can vary greatly . We decide what the starting order and the differential between start times should be , '' explains Craig . `` You do n't want to have a one hour starting sequence but at the same time you do n't want one class of boats running over a second 15 minutes into a race . There 's an awful lot that goes into it . It 's a challenge , but it 's a challenge we really enjoy . '' One additional layer of complexity is that racing may take place simultaneously on more than one course . While one group may be contesting windward/leeward racing on a narrow , short racecourse , others will be embarking on a coastal race upwards of 40-nm through La Maddalena 's rocky archipelago . `` We have YCCS service boats with very capable people tracking the boats reporting back to the race officer what the wind conditions are , where the boats are on the racetrack , if conditions are changing drastically . '' Shared respect Monitoring the finish line is generally easier than the start but scrutiny is still needed . In the Mini Maxi Rolex World Championship it is not uncommon to have two or three boats finishing in close proximity . Results then have to be calculated and published . For Craig this ends a busy , stressful but enjoyable day . `` When the Race Management team have pulled off a great day 's racing , particularly on the hard , difficult days , it 's the same satisfaction you experience when you have a great day as a competitor . You come in feeling good about what you 've done .

PAS will reject the position of Selangor Menteri Besar even if it is offered the post , its deputy president Mohamad Sabu said today , despite party president Datuk Seri Abdul Hadi Awang having named one or more of its assemblymen for the position . Mohamad Sabu said this after a PAS central committee meeting today . Also at the meeting was PAS secretary-general Datuk Mustafa Ali , who said the party 's position was still the same as had been conveyed to the Pakatan Rakyat leadership council earlier . `` We are leaving it to the Sultan of Selangor , '' he added . . At a meeting on August 17 , the PAS central committee had decided to nominate both PKR president Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail and her deputy , Azmin Ali , as Selangor MB . The committee was by-passed when Hadi independently submitted the names of three other assemblymen to the Selangor Palace . Among the names submitted were Selangor PAS commissioner Iskandar Samad , who is the Chempaka assemblyman . Mustafa , however , said Iskandar 's name being sent to the palace would not be an issue . The majority of the state assemblymen are still backing Dr Wan Azizah , who is also the Kajang assemblyman , for the post . PKR has obtained statutory declarations from 30 legislators , including two from PAS , in support of her . The central committee today reaffirmed its plan to stick to its earlier decision .

Pascoe replaces experienced administrator Ben Mannion , who was appointed as Newcastle 's general manager of football last month but has been left high and dry after the recent change in club ownership . Mannion , who had been Football Queensland 's chief operating officer for past three years , came to the Jets when the club was still owned by Nathan Tinkler 's Hunter Sports Group . At the time , Jets chief executive Mitchell Murphy described Mannion as a `` first-rate sporting administrator '' and his appointment as a `` major coup '' for the club .

Pascoe and fellow assistant Mark Jones were released from the Jets when coach Phil Stubbins was axed last month , as new owners Football Federation Australia announced it would seek a new manager as part of a fresh start for the 2015-16 season . The club announced on Thursday that Pascoe would start immediately in assisting with Newcastle 's pre-season planning and development , player recruitment and A-League compliance matters . `` James brings the right football and administrative skills , but as importantly has a great insight into football in Northern NSW and the elite player pathways , '' said A-League boss Damien de Bohun . `` This appointment is the first of many steps to ensure that there is a strong Novocastrian spirit in the new club that is taking shape .

Alec also shared a photo taken with Melania in 2007 , writing , `` We have a chair waiting for you in the @nbcsnl make-up room '' . We `` know what you 're thinking '' , he added . And then do SNL w me . Few doubted that Baldwin 's offer was a serious one . In 2002 , a woman from Texas , Marie Schoedinger , had accused Bush of allegedly kidnapping , drugging and raping her . Even if she declines his invitation , we will always have Cecily Strong 's delightful Melania impression . `` As I said back in November when he first said this , that is not true , which is why Mr. Baldwin has no actual names to corroborate his weird assertion '' , Grisham told People . `` But , could she ? If she want to ? '' When she vanished from the public eye for almost a month , some even anxious that she had been intentionally silenced or relocated . However , the First Lady and her fashion choices have been making news lately especially after she wore a '' I REALLY DO N'T CARE , DO U ? '' jacket on her way to tour a shelter for migrant kids . President Trump , however , later claimed it was a message to the `` fake news '' .", "names": [{"name": "alec baldwin", "ids": ["Q170572"], "offsets": [[0, 2], [24, 25], [53, 54], [89, 90], [119, 120], [150, 151], [200, 201], [271, 272]]}, {"name": "melania trump", "ids": ["Q432473"], "offsets": [[3, 5], [125, 126], [157, 158], [246, 247]]}, {"name": "ron matthews", "ids": ["Q2472572"], "offsets": [[15, 17]]}, {"name": "meghan , duchess of sussex", "ids": ["Q3304418"], "offsets": [[20, 21], [33, 34], [52, 53], [80, 81], [95, 96], [111, 112], [118, 119], [130, 131], [146, 147], [160, 161], [162, 163], [186, 187], [210, 211], [215, 216], [218, 219], [222, 223], [225, 226], [237, 238], [261, 262], [266, 267], [282, 283], [289, 290], [310, 311], [324, 325], [348, 349], [367, 368], [369, 370], [412, 413], [452, 453], [466, 467], [475, 476], [501, 502], [528, 529], [532, 533], [556, 557], [562, 563], [575, 576], [579, 580], [591, 592], [633, 634], [679, 680], [695, 696], [781, 782], [789, 790], [808, 809], [838, 839], [843, 844], [863, 864], [870, 871], [875, 876], [899, 904], [904, 905], [916, 917], [919, 920], [931, 932], [938, 939], [961, 962]]}, {"name": "cecily strong", "ids": ["Q5056524"], "offsets": [[242, 244]]}, {"name": "donald trump", "ids": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"], "offsets": [[366, 367], [385, 387], [430, 431]]}, {"name": "jorge sampaoli", "ids": ["Q1089864"], "offsets": [[499, 501], [912, 914]]}, {"name": "salem al-dawsari", "ids": ["Q3945419"], "offsets": [[550, 552]]}, {"name": "dermot gallagher", "ids": ["Q5262805", "Q738512"], "offsets": [[635, 637]]}, {"name": "unai emery", "ids": ["Q295610"], "offsets": [[697, 699]]}, {"name": "lasse schone", "ids": ["Q313112"], "offsets": [[854, 856]]}, {"name": "prince harry", "ids": ["Q152316"], "offsets": [[896, 898]]}, {"name": "franco armani", "ids": ["Q5484508"], "offsets": [[959, 961]]}]}, {"articleID": "2018071521_00031156_W", "content": "Crisostomo 's convictions over rape , killing of Romero affirmed Tag : car , DNA , life , William Bodziak Joseph Acosta Crisostomo The CNMI Supreme Court has affirmed the convictions of notorious habitual offender Joseph Acosta Crisostomo , who was slapped with a life sentence for the kidnapping , raping , and killing of bartender Emerita R. Romero . In a 39-page opinion issued Friday , the high court justices said even after omitting the errors in Superior Court Associate Judge Joseph Camacho 's rulings in the case , numerous evidence remains . `` We find sufficiently strong , unrefuted evidence supporting Crisostomo 's conviction , and are unable to say , even when taken together , that it is more probable than not that the errors materially affected the verdict . We decline to reverse for cumulative error , '' said the Supreme Court 's opinion penned by Associate Justice John A. Manglona and concurred by Chief Justice Alexandro C. Castro and Associate Justice Perry B. Inos . Crisostomo , through counsel Janet H. King , appealed his convictions claiming numerous deficiencies before and during trial . The defendant presented 10 issues : denial of expert testimony ; admission of expert testimony ; denial of his motion to transfer venue ; failure to reiterate jury instructions at the close of evidence ; admission of improper character evidence ; admission of testimony based on impermissibly suggestive identification ; admission of footprint evidence ; use of Skype testimony ; admission of testimony concerning refusal to submit to polygraph examination ; and cumulative errors resulting in an unfair trial . Then-assistant attorney general Matthew C. Baisley argued for the government before the CNMI Supreme Court . Then-interim chief prosecutor Brian Flaherty and then-assistant attorney general Margo Brown-Badawy represented the government at the trial . On the denial of expert testimony issue , the justices ruled that Superior Court Associate Judge Joseph N. Camacho did not allow either counsel to question Crisostomo 's DNA expert Dr. David Haymer as to his methodology and its reliability , nor did the judge inquire as to these issues on his own accord , failing to establish a sufficiently developed record for the high court 's review . The justices said Camacho unreasonably limited the evidence regarding the reliability and application of Haymer 's methodology , and , as a result , prematurely rendered his conclusion on Haymer 's admissibility . The justices said because of this error , Camacho could not make specific findings on the record . `` The manner in which the court made its rulings was manifestly erroneous , based on an erroneous view of the law , '' said the justices in concluding that Camacho abused his discretion . The justices , however , ruled that although Camacho erred in determining the admissibility of Haymer testimony , a close review leads the high court to conclude the exclusion was harmless . The justices said Crisostomo did not seek to introduce Haymer to testify about any evidence , rather , his testimony was sought to point out potential flaws in Federal Bureau of Investigation DNA analyst Susana Kehl 's interpretation of the DNA mixture . The justices said although the exclusion of Haymer rendered Crisostomo 's trial imperfect , it was nonetheless fair . `` We find a fair assurance of harmlessness that the error did not materially affect the verdict : had Haymer been able to testify , it is more probable than not that the same verdict would have been returned , '' said the justices , concluding that they deem the error harmless . On barefoot morphology expert William Bodziak 's testimony , the justices said they find it evident -- and certainly more probable than not -- that Camacho would have nonetheless admitted Bodziak as an expert after a proper reliability determination . `` As such , we deem the failure to make findings as to the reliability of barefoot morphology harmless , '' the justices said . With respect to change venue issue , the justices found Crisostomo 's vague claim as insufficient . The justices said discussion of certain jurors ' knowledge of the case in the news is insufficient ; the constitution requires the trier of fact to be impartial , not ignorant . `` We thus defer to the province of the trial judge and find no abuse of discretion , '' the justices said . On jury instructions matter , the justices said because the judge has broad discretion in deciding to give a cautionary instruction rather than declare a mistrial and they ( justices ) assume the judge 's curative instruction was followed so as to overcome any prejudicial effect of a witness ' statement , they find no error . Pertaining to identification of Crisostomo 's voice in the 911 call issue , the justices said despite the police officers ' suggestive setup , Joanne Castro , Crisostomo 's prior live-in partner of 17 years , was able to give a reliable identification , rendering the out-of-the court identification admissible . `` We find no due process violation , '' the justices pointed out . On footprint evidence , the justices concluded that the taking of Crisostomo 's footprints was not a critical stage of the proceeding and that subsequently admitting evidence of Crisostomo 's footprints did not violate his Sixth Amendment right to counsel . The justices found no error in Camacho admitting the footprint evidence . On Skype testimony , the justices said given that Camacho did not err in allowing David Snyder to testify via Skype , they find no plain error occurred . Snyder is the forensic audio examiner who enhanced Romero 's 911 call . With respect to polygraph testimony , the justices said any error in admitting the testimony about Crisostomo 's refusal to submit to a polygraph was not plain in light of the record as a whole . `` Accordingly , we find no plain error , '' the justices said . On cumulative error , the justices said they weigh the aggregate prejudicial effect of the trial errors against the sum of the evidence presented against Crisostomo . The justices noted Camacho 's errors in four issues , particularly the denial of Crisostomo 's DNA rebuttal expert , were undeniably prejudicial . The justices said , however , the government 's evidence pointing to Crisostomo as the perpetrator was undeniably strong . The justices highlighted some of this evidence . The justices said in particular , Alice Kintaro , Shaine Castro , and Crisostomo himself all identified Crisostomo as driving a vehicle matching the description of that seen by Natalie Ocon . The justices said hair and fiber in the rented car were consistent with Romero 's hair , leggings , and fibers found on her shoe . The justices said three individuals separately identified Crisostomo 's voice on a 911 call where Romero was heard pleading to be released , complaining that her neck hurt , and asking to pick up her pants . The justices said without knowing either party , the 911 operator identified the female voice as Filipina and the male voice as local . The justices said cell tower records matched Romero and Cristomo 's movement , including pinging Crisostomo 's borrowed phone in Marpi at 6am on Feb. 5 . The justices said footprints matching Crisostomo 's were found at La Fiesta next to drag marks . The justices said Crisostomo was seen by a witness attempting to sell a Blackberry Torch shortly after . The justices noted Kehl 's testimony of a 1 in 960 million probability that the DNA found in Romero belonged to someone in the Chamorro population other than Crisostomo . The justices said the government notes Crisostomo has taken an `` everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach '' to the appeal , and that they agree . In addition , the justices pointed out that Crisostomo 's briefing is littered with violations of the NMI Supreme Court rules , conclusory statements , underwhelming legal arguments , and misstatements of law . Camacho presided over the trial and decided the misdemeanor charges . He found the defendant guilty of assault and battery , and disturbing the peace . On April 24 , 2014 , the jury reached a guilty verdict against the then-40-year-old Crisostomo as to the charges of first degree murder , kidnapping , sexual assault in the first degree , and robbery . On May 28 , 2014 , Camacho sentenced Crisostomo to life imprisonment . Romero , 37 , was last seen boarding a car near her house in Garapan in the early morning of Feb. 5 , 2012 . She was supposed to meet her boyfriend in Chalan Piao . Two days later , FBI agents found her body in a small bathroom at the abandoned La Fiesta Mall in San Roque/As Matuis . Autopsy revealed she was beaten and strangled with a pair of leggings .

Although one of the accused , Rand Stevenson , testified Monday in Fort Macleod , the trial had to be adjourned after co-accused Brent Derricott was unable to attend court Tuesday due to an ongoing battle with a foot infection . It 's the second time the trial has been adjourned because of Derricott 's health ; the first adjournment was Sept. 15 when Stevenson , Derricott and Robert Smylski were scheduled to begin their defence . Don Young , chief litigation counsel for the ASC , said Thursday he 's prepared to delay the case in deference to Derricott 's illness , but not indefinitely . `` At some point we need to continue the trial , '' he said . The three men face some 62 charges under the Alberta Securities Act relating to unauthorized trading in securities . Stevenson , 63 , and Derricott , 62 , are charged with trading in OCI Q Corp. securities without registration or a prospectus and making misleading or untrue statements to investors . Smylski , 64 , is charged with failing to comply with a previous order by the Alberta Securities Commission . Only Stevenson is represented by a lawyer . The ASC alleges that $ 1.2 million was raised between 2009 and 2011 from more than 50 investors through loan agreements with six-month terms , with the promise of returns of up to 150 times the loan amount . The funds were purportedly to be used to obtain the release of a billion-dollar inheritance connected to the late president Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines . The Crown says many investors , who have not seen any of the promised returns on their money , had no idea their money was being used to cover the accused 's personal expenses . Defence insists , however , investors have not been misled and the project is not a sham . During Monday 's hearing much of Stevenson 's testimony covered the project itself and information about the project contained in a binder . Defence successfully argued to have the contents of the binder placed under a publication ban .

Toure broke the deadlock with a crucial strike eight minutes from time , with Sergio Aguero then also notching in a 2-0 win in the Barclays Premier League . The Ivorian 's long-range effort at Villa Park provided a timely reminder of his talents after a difficult start to the season in which his performances have been criticised . Toure now intends to build momentum and keep City firing at the top end of the table . `` I think it was amazing , '' the 31-year-old told Sky Sports of his decisive goal . `` If it was not me it would have been Aguero or ( David ) Silva . `` The most important thing is for me to do my best . I 'm keeping going : I play for a top side in Europe . And I 'll just do my best to win things again this season . `` It 's not so easy because you have to play every three days . I 'm not a machine - I 'm a man . But it 's important to keep things going . `` I have great team-mates around me , and the most important thing is to do my best . '' Toure 's poor form has come after a difficult summer in which he voiced criticisms of the club and lost his brother to cancer . Manager Manuel Pellegrini insisted he never had any concerns about the player 's state of mind and was always sure the influential midfielder would rediscover his dynamism . Pellegrini said : `` Yaya is an experienced player . He can be criticised for one or two weeks but I know perfectly the way he thinks and the way he can play , so I never had a problem about that . `` Yaya last season also played bad games , but he scored so many goals that everyone thought about that . `` We started the season and Yaya knows he must improve every game and he is trying to do it . I do n't have any concern about him . He is one of the best midfielders , without any doubt . '' City were frustrated for long spells at Villa Park by the hosts ' committed defending but Pellegrini felt the victory was deserved . City had earlier hit the woodwork twice , through Aleksandar Kolarov and Aguero . Pellegrini said : `` I do n't know if the word is relieved . We deserved to win before the goal . We had a lot of clear chances to score . `` I think we played the best game of the season in ( terms of ) possession , chances , the way we defended , intensity , the way we recovered the ball and the way we work . '' The result also applied pressure to leaders Chelsea , who are in action against Arsenal on Sunday . `` Always the title will be decided by one or two points , '' Pellegrini said . `` We can not do anything about Chelsea but we can do what we did today . '' The downside for City was the loss of midfielder Fernandinho , who limped off just before the hour and will now be assessed . `` We will see ( on Sunday ) with the doctor , '' Pellegrini said . `` He has a problem with his hamstring . '' Villa boss Paul Lambert felt his side acquitted themselves well against difficult opposition . He said : `` For 82 minutes we were in it and Kieran ( Richardson ) had a really good chance after they hit the post . That is how tight it is . `` When you play against these sides , if you get a chance you have to take it . `` For 82 minutes , the lads were excellent , they did really well , but the two lads that scored the goals are top players themselves . '' The defeat was Villa 's third in succession after previous losses to Arsenal and Chelsea . That run has taken the gloss off what had been a bright start to the season but , given the toughness of the opposition , Lambert was not downbeat . He said : `` Today I thought we were well in it against a team I think will be close to winning it . '' One positive for Villa was the return of striker Christian Benteke as a substitute after six months out with a ruptured Achilles . `` He played half an hour , '' Lambert said . `` It is great for the club , his team-mates and himself to get back playing . There were little glimpses there that he will be back to his best soon . '' Lambert also confirmed that captain Gabriel Agbonlahor pulled out of the game after feeling unwell during the warm-up . Steve Bruce was left to eulogise about Mohamed Diame 's impact at Hull after the deadline day signing 's third goal in four matches helped his side to victory over Crystal Palace . Embattled Newcastle manager Alan Pardew insisted his side 's fightback at Swansea is proof that his players continue to give everything for him . Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet saluted striker Steven Fletcher after seeing him emerge from the shadows to fire the club to a first Barclays Premier League victory of the season .", "date": "2014-10-04 21:00:36", "url": "http://www.shropshirestar.com/sport/uk-sport/2014/10/04/toure-ill-just-keep-doing-my-best/", "phase": "E", "title": "Toure : I 'll just keep doing my best `` Shropshire Star", "names": [{"name": "manuel pellegrini", "ids": ["Q296036"], "offsets": [[254, 256], [281, 282], [404, 405], [425, 426], [529, 530], [587, 588]]}, {"name": "aleksandar kolarov", "ids": ["Q211451"], "offsets": [[420, 422]]}, {"name": "paul lambert", "ids": ["Q246724", "Q42306921", "Q47511367", "Q52134533", "Q7151926", "Q7151928", "Q7151929", "Q7151930"], "offsets": [[602, 604], [737, 738], [798, 799], [834, 835]]}, {"name": "christian benteke", "ids": ["Q60326"], "offsets": [[776, 778]]}, {"name": "gabriel agbonlahor", "ids": ["Q135314"], "offsets": [[839, 841]]}, {"name": "steve bruce", "ids": ["Q331904"], "offsets": [[853, 855]]}, {"name": "mohamed diame", "ids": ["Q380128"], "offsets": [[860, 862]]}, {"name": "alan pardew", "ids": ["Q360491"], "offsets": [[889, 891]]}, {"name": "gus poyet", "ids": ["Q338595"], "offsets": [[913, 915]]}, {"name": "steven fletcher", "ids": ["Q150238", "Q3499223", "Q6379374"], "offsets": [[917, 919]]}]}, {"articleID": "2018073021_00165509_W", "content": "Trump and Meghan 's got titles , Thomas Markle needs one too Monday , 30 July 2018 15:17 Trump and Meghan 's got titles , Thomas Markle needs one too Call him `` Everyman . '' For that is who Thomas Markle , Sr. , the estranged , increasingly noisy dad of Meghan Markle , really is . Thomas Markle is one of us . He 's got three kids , one of whom just married into the British royal family . He 's got a pension . He 's got a silver Volvo . He 's got a penchant for McDonald 's and KFC cuisine . He 's got a testy ex-wife . He 's got Social Security . He 's got a heart condition . And now , he 's got a fan club . Yup -- I kid you not . Although the online `` Sugars '' are rabid in their rage at Thomas Markle 's outspoken criticism of his daughter and her `` new family , '' the British royals , Thomas Markle has fans -- real fans , at home and abroad . We fans like Thomas Markle . We like him a lot . We do n't always agree with him , like his views that Brexit is bad and Trump is bad and McDonald 's is good . But Thomas Markle is a born , full-blooded American citizen and , hey , he has a right to not like Brexit and not like Donald Trump . He also has a right to say that he wants his daughter to phone him and let him back into her now-very-cushy life . He has a right to slyly mock Prince Charles 's boxy double-breasted suits -- after all , Charles did n't really stand in for Thomas at Meghan 's wedding as much as he displaced him and dissed him . Thomas has a right to call the British crown `` dusty . '' Colonists fought a bitter and bloody revolutionary war back in 1776 so that we could create the United States of America and not pay tax on tea . Over the years , this all got translated into how we no longer had to bow to any royals or aristocrats unless they are Queen Beyonce and King Jay Z. And even then , that 's only because we really , really want to bow to them . But America 's Revolution also all got translated into how we can say what we like about anyone -- even the Queen of England , as long as we do n't violate other rules like defamation . And even that can get kind of stretchy over here . England 's a different story . England is secretly rigid . No gold star for violent anti-Trump protesting ; Go high , not low No gold star for violent anti-Trump protesting ; Go high , not low England pretends to be a democracy , but it 's really a monarchy wherein the monarchy has far more personal power than is usually openly acknowledged . The Queen has a lot of secret power that nobody talks about . Not yet . Not openly . But it 's like when POTUS Donald Trump came to visit , and the British got all worked up because supposedly the Queen was supposed to walk first , but then Trump walked first . And then , there was the whole mish-mash about whether Trump had insulted the Queen by arriving too late or too early . Brits got so agitated ! And all the while , Londoners who failed to get up early and vote against Brexit and lost thought they 'd be creative and fly a mocking balloon of Trump around . I mean , this they work at , instead of getting up early and voting against Brexit ! I wish that Thomas Markle liked President Trump , but the fact that Markle lives in Mexico rather than the United States gives a hint that there are other things going on with him . I wonder if he snuck across the border to vote in the last election , or whether he sent in an absentee ballot , or maybe , like those loony Londoners with their insulting Trump balloon , he just failed to get up in the morning to vote against Brexit . I mean , Trump . But it 's no biggie . We share a lot of likes with Thomas Markle , and we also respect his right to bad-mouth the Ruler of the Free World , although it 's not what we would do , and we do n't like it when Thomas Markle does it . We also think that Brexit was voted on , and if democracy means anything , it means that `` leave means leave . '' So even though we are devoted Thomas Markle fans , we do n't agree with him on many things . Well , actually , we do like KFC and McDonald 's . But our cardiologist has told us to cut back . So we want the name of Thomas 's cardiologist so we can get a second opinion because we have n't had a fish sandwich ( add pickles ) , fries and a hot apple pie in ages . Not since our last , well , not exactly a heart attack . Call it ... palpitations . McDonald 's kind of makes our heart go pitty-pat . Maybe it 's just because we love the fish sandwich ( add pickles ) so much ! Or maybe we had too many fries . Or maybe something else is going on that one should really measure with an electrocardiogram . But Thomas Markle loves McDonald 's and we love him for it because that indicates that Thomas Everyman is a man who 's ordinarily easy to please . And our beloved POTUS , Donald Trump , also has a fine appreciation for McDonald 's -- so maybe that 's some common ground between the Everyman Father-in-Law of New Royalty and the Everyman Leader of the Free World . We recognize that space . It 's called ... Freedom . And Thomas Markle is exercising his . So look what happened when he did that ! The London newspapers went bonkers ! The Sugars are furiously tippy-tapping keyboards across the continents and even Australia ( a former prison colony ) , hoping to make Thomas Markle back off from his griping that Meghan has cruelly cut off all communication with him -- and for what ? For saying that she wants a baby , and that Prince Harry wants a baby , too ? He points out that he 's merely repeating something both Meghan and Harry have said themselves -- Harry voiced his desires for a gaa-gaa-goo-goo in a public , televised interview a while back , when Meghan was little more than an aging , actressy whiff we all thought would willow-the wisp away and give Chelsy Davy time to collect her senses and marry Harry . Sigh . It was not to be . So we all made the adjustment and started looking at Meghan , scrutinizing , and folks were wondering exactly how Meghan gets her hair to do what it does , which is to fly all around in weird ways while she twirls it about . She 's oddly fidgety for an actress , that Meghan . Suddenly , Meghan 's half-sister , the irrepressible Samantha ( unlike Meghan , Samantha has no need for an identifying last name ) burst forth with a barrage of criticism that at first stunned the Sugars and then pushed them into battle . Samantha was then backed up by her brother , Thomas Markle , Jr. , whose words might have packed more punch if he had not been arrested for menacing his fianc\u00e9e with a gun ( hey , he 's got a right to that gun , now , this is America , thank you ! ) . But Thomas , Jr. explained it all by stating that he had a drinking problem ( love the sinner , hate the sin ) , and then his fianc\u00e9e became physically abusive and was arrested , and he wailed that Meghan had abandoned him and Samantha even though they 'd all once been very close . Thomas , Jr. even showed what appears to be some kind of obtuse and unhelpful text from Prince Harry 's `` office . '' I do n't exactly know why the royals , who do no actual `` work , '' need `` offices . '' But they have them , and these office guys who work for the royals-who-do-no-work made a few phone calls but apparently not much was done to bring Meghan 's relatives into the royal fold . Only her mother , Doria Ragland , was flown in for the royal wedding , to which Meghan wore a dress that looked like a Halloween ghost costume pinned together with sheets that cost something like half a million dollars -- an odd choice for a woman who claims to be a professional humanitarian because half a million dollars buys , well , let 's see -- $ 34 donated to Oxfam buys an African farmer a goat , so half a million dollars buys the farmer 14,705.8 goats . And that 's with tax and shipping included ! That 's a lot of goats that could change the face of Africa forever . But instead of buying thousands of goats , Meghan spent it all on the Halloween ghost costume wedding gown . And although the royals bought Doria a very nice minty-green outfit and little cocktail party hat to wear , they did n't let her stay in England more than three days . They whooshed her in by private jet and then whooshed her to tea and penny jam sandwiches with the Queen , and then whooshed her to the wedding so she could look `` dignified '' and take some `` family '' wedding photos , and then whooshed her back to Los Angeles so fast it made our heads swim . Doria then immediately quit her day job , which made many suspicious that the royals had paid Doria off to remain `` dignified ' and not exercise her God-given , Revolution-won free speech rights . It 's a lot easier to be `` dignified '' when you do n't have to rush off to your day job . But for some reason , Samantha , Thomas Markle , Jr. and Thomas Markle , Sr. were n't whooshed by Buckingham Palace anywhere . No matter . They 've proved much more interesting than anyone previously thought possible . Thomas Markle , Sr. has so many fans now , and so many folks are getting sick of seeing the newly enduchessed Meghan swirl around in $ 3,500 denim dresses from high-end designers when she could be buying goats for Africa , that we are starting a fan club to support his upcoming trip to London . I kid you not ! ( goat pun , not intended ) . Thomas Markle 's our man . He 's our Everyman . Thomas Markle 's an American . He 's not loud -- at least not in his recorded interviews . But he is vocal and he is insistent , he 's got a Santa Claus-size belly , and he is complaining that his daughter is self-absorbed and not paying him any attention . He grouses that he paid for her expensive private schools , paid for her expensive private college , and paid for her to take fun trips . He paid for her to become an actress , although the only heights she achieved were a burger-flipping video where her boobs are all pushed up , some kind of game show where she walked around with an attach\u00e9 case , and a Canadian-based cheesy serialized law office drama , `` Suits . '' In all of these , she 's wearing hooker-high high heels -- the kind of shoes Princess Diana herself called `` tart 's trotters . '' But Diana wore hers while tripping the light fantastic , whereas Meghan wears her pointy stilettos on the polo field , which leaves holes in the ground wherever she walks , and causes her to grip Prince Harry 's arm like she 's become unable to walk by herself . We feel Thomas Markle 's pain and frustration ! We want him to come to London . We will pick him up from Heathrow , whoosh him into Paddington , and walk him across Hyde Park to Kensington Palace , where he can exercise his freedom of speech by yelling `` Meghan ! I love you ! Please talk to me ! '' at the top of his lungs outside the gates . We will all hold up signs saying the same . We shall all chip in and buy him a memorable cream tea somewhere nice . Then , we 'll get him a ticket for the Big Red Bus and he can take in all the sights . We 'll make a special stop at Parliament , just in case someone wants him to say something . We can even whoosh him over to Windsor and show him St. George 's Chapel where Meghan pranced about in her ghost sheets costume and Prince Charles took Thomas 's place at the wedding . It may be a tad emotional , but the chapel is a totally cool place and very roomy now that Oprah 's not in it . And there 's a fine McDonald 's on Thames Street , right by Windsor Castle . Now that 's a tour ! We have plans for Thomas Markle ! And now , he 's got a fan club . He 's got supporters ! We 'll buy him lunch at his favorite place . Big Macs and fries all around ! Perhaps we can even buy him an aristocratic title . Yes -- English titles CAN be bought ! Scottish and Irish ones , too . Just ask Pippa Middleton 's in-laws . Then , the British world will have to bend the knee to Lord Thomas Markle . If there 's any cash left over , we can buy Africa some Oxfam goats . Stay tuned .", "date": "2018-07-30 21:48:22", "url": "http://bayoubuzz.com/bb/donald-trump-news-today/donald-trump-news/item/1063525-trump-and-meghan-s-got-titles-should-thomas-markle-get-one-too", "phase": "E", "title": "Trump and Meghan 's got titles , Thomas Markle needs one too Sarah Whalen", "names": [{"name": "president trump", "ids": ["Q22686"], "offsets": [[0, 1], [18, 19], [216, 217], [567, 568], [581, 582], [628, 629], [656, 657], [718, 719], [738, 739]]}, {"name": "meghan markle", "ids": ["Q3304418"], "offsets": [[2, 3], [20, 21], [52, 54], [303, 304], [662, 663], [1096, 1097], [1138, 1139], [1163, 1164], [1211, 1212], [1221, 1222], [1255, 1256], [1259, 1260], [1268, 1269], [1397, 1398], [1486, 1487], [1511, 1512], [1616, 1617], [1839, 1840], [2068, 2069], [2158, 2159], [2262, 2263]]}, {"name": "thomas markle", "ids": ["Q43918214"], "offsets": [[7, 9], [25, 27], [40, 42], [58, 60], [156, 158], [175, 177], [191, 193], [226, 228], [301, 302], [316, 317], [652, 654], [753, 755], [787, 789], [822, 824], [864, 865], [966, 968], [981, 982], [1045, 1047], [1088, 1090], [1309, 1311], [1358, 1359], [1413, 1414], [1785, 1787], [1790, 1792], [1817, 1819], [1887, 1889], [1898, 1900], [2109, 2111], [2274, 2275], [2333, 2335], [2413, 2415]]}, {"name": "queen of england", "ids": ["Q9682"], "offsets": [[51, 52], [62, 63], [72, 73], [161, 162], [348, 349], [381, 382], [426, 429], [448, 449], [453, 454], [459, 460], [490, 491], [518, 519], [522, 523], [558, 559], [585, 586], [627, 628], [640, 641], [750, 751], [766, 767], [863, 864], [917, 918], [1021, 1022], [1028, 1029], [1285, 1286], [1424, 1425], [1597, 1598], [1604, 1605], [1610, 1611], [1613, 1614], [1654, 1655], [1679, 1680], [1834, 1835], [2006, 2007], [2033, 2034], [2045, 2046], [2153, 2154], [2173, 2174]]}, {"name": "donald trump", "ids": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"], "offsets": [[250, 252], [542, 544], [998, 1000]]}, {"name": "prince charles", "ids": ["Q43274"], "offsets": [[284, 286], [294, 295], [2271, 2273]]}, {"name": "prince harry", "ids": ["Q152316"], "offsets": [[1120, 1122], [1140, 1141], [1145, 1146], [1191, 1192], [1430, 1432], [2093, 2095]]}, {"name": "chelsy davy", "ids": ["Q529485"], "offsets": [[1182, 1184]]}, {"name": "doria ragland", "ids": ["Q43918160"], "offsets": [[1498, 1500], [1633, 1634], [1720, 1721], [1737, 1738]]}, {"name": "st. george", "ids": ["Q42306290"], "offsets": [[2257, 2259]]}, {"name": "pippa middleton", "ids": ["Q232465"], "offsets": [[2395, 2397]]}]}, {"articleID": "2014081803_00016533_W", "content": "` BATMAN : Assault on Arkham ' : 5 Takeaways from the new animated adventure Comic Riffs | David Betancourt Free and Easy : Civil War Weekend , #SummerCool Block Party , Kush Abadey Cleveland Browns wide receiver AnthonyArmstrong catches a long pass against cornerback Jordan Poyer during training camp . ( Mark Duncan/Associated Press ) Cleveland Browns to FedEx Field on Monday night . In addition to former offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan , who coached in Washington the past four seasons , and two other former assistant coaches , the Browns also now have three past Redskins players on the roster . Anthony Armstrong , who played in Washington in 2010 and 2011 now is looking to make the Browns ' 53-man roster . Tight end Emmanuel Ogbuehi , who signed with Washington as an undrafted rookie in 2013 but did n't survive final roster cuts , also plays for the Browns . Rex Grossman , who played with Washington for four years . This is now Grossman 's third stint with Shanahan , having played under him in Houston before following him to Washington . Washington 's players last week were happy to hear Grossman , who started for Washington in 2011 , had found work . Left tackle Trent Williams said he had wondered why Cleveland had n't signed Grossman sooner . But wide receiver Santana Moss and cornerback DeAngelo Hall both half-jokingly commended Grossman on making a smart veteran move in waiting until the end of training camp to agree to a deal . Grossman remained a popular figure in Washington 's locker room the past two seasons even after Robert Griffin III and Kirk Cousins arrived on the scene , knocking the veteran down to third string . Players all liked Grossman 's aggressive style of play and willingness to go for the gusto , even though at times , he would keep both teams in the game , gunning touchdown passes and interceptions with nearly the same frequency . Tongue in cheek , Hall lamented the fact that he would n't be in the game still by the time Grossman took the field . `` If I was n't trying to just get out of [ this preseason game ] healthy , I 'd probably ask to go back into the game to face Rex , '' he said . `` We all know he 's going to throw some 50-50 balls up there , because he 's a gunslinger . '' Shanahan brought with him to Cleveland assistants Mike McDaniel ( wide receivers coach ) and Richard Hightower ( special teams assistant in Washington and now an offensive assistant ) . Shanahan and Griffin had their clashes . But Washington 's other offensive players have a great deal of respect for their former offensive coordinator . Wide receivers Pierre Garcon and Santana Moss praised Shanahan as a great offensive mind , and said they still had a good relationship with him . Backup quarterback Kirk Cousins also expressed gratitude for Shanahan 's work with him , and said `` I always felt like his preparation and game planning always put me in a position to succeed . '' Fullback Darrel Young , who joined Washington 's practice squad as a linebacker late in 2009 , but under Shanahan made the switch to fullback and started all four years , also had high praise for Shanahan . `` It 's kind of weird seeing him in Brown , '' Young said . `` But I have the utmost respect for Kyle because he put me in position to be a starter for this Redskins organization , and he allowed me to put some good stuff on tape so I could earn Jay 's confidence . So , my hat 's off to him . But obviously , I want to win this game . '' Have a Redskins question ?

The conversations will focus on immigrants , people with disabilities , seniors , LGBTQ individuals and all racial and religious communities . The dialogue is part of the city 's Where We Live NYC initiative , which aims to satisfy the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 's requirement that governments and public housing authorities receiving HUD funding are taking steps to overcome segregation . Under President Donald Trump , HUD has extended the deadline by which funding recipients must complete related analyses , but the city said it will continue operating on the original timeline and release a framework to promote integration in fall 2019 . `` Where We Live NYC is an unprecedented opportunity to work with government partners , community organizations , and the general public to take a comprehensive look at the historic and ongoing factors that contribute to long-standing patterns of segregation in our neighborhoods , and discuss what we as a City can do to increase housing choice and access to opportunity for all New Yorkers , '' Maria Torres-Springer , the city 's Department of Housing Preservation and Development commissioner , said in a statement . `` I look forward to having meaningful and candid conversations as we work together to make our city stronger , fairer , and more equitable . '' Torres-Springer 's department will be working with several city agencies , the New York City Housing Authority and a Fair Housing Stakeholder Group to understand and address how various segregation patterns impact access to jobs , education , public transit and health . Beyond looking at data and analyzing policies , the city will glean insight through conversations with members of communities across the five boroughs , beginning this summer . The city plans to hire a consulting firm and racial justice organization to facilitate these public dialogues . A survey also will inform the initiative , which aims to have specific policy solutions to present in fall 2018 and a final framework with measurable goals to release in fall 2019 .

( AP Photo/Joe Schaber , File ) LONDON ( AP ) -- George Michael , who rocketed to stardom with WHAM ! and went on to enjoy a long and celebrated solo career lined with controversies , has died , his publicist said Sunday . He was 53 . Michael died at his home in Goring , England . His publicist , Cindi Berger , said he had not been ill . No other details were released . He enjoyed immense popularity early in his career as a teenybopper idol , delivering a series of hits such as `` Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go , '' '' Young Guns ( Go For It ) '' and `` Freedom . '' As a solo artist , he developed into a more serious singer and songwriter , lauded by critics for his tremendous vocal range . He sold well over 100 million albums globally , earned numerous Grammy and American Music Awards , and recorded duets with legends like Aretha Franklin , Ray Charles , Luciano Pavarotti and Elton John . Throughout his career , his drug use and taste for risky sex brought him into frequent brushes with the law , most famously in 1998 when he was arrested for public lewdness in Los Angeles . Yet , he managed to turn the incident into fodder for a popular song that poked fun at his behavior , and his acknowledgment of his homosexuality at that time made him even more popular with his fans . Michael , with startling good looks and an easy stage manner , formed the boy band WHAM ! with his school friend Andrew Ridgeley in the early 1980s . Helped by MTV , which was an emerging music industry force at the time , the cheerful duo easily crossed the Atlantic to become popular in the United States with Michael , as lead singer , usually the focal point . He started his solo career shortly before WHAM ! split , with the release of the megahit single `` Careless Whisper , '' making a seamless transition . Critics generally viewed his WHAM ! songs as catchy but disposable pop and gave his solo efforts far higher marks . His first solo album , 1987 's `` Faith , '' sold more 20 million copies , and he enjoyed several hit singles including the raunchy `` I Want Your Sex , '' which was helped immeasurably by a provocative video that received wide air play on MTV . The song was controversial not only because of its explicit nature , but also because it was seen as encouraging casual sex and promiscuity at a time when the AIDS epidemic was deepening . Michael and his management tried to tamp down this point of view by having the singer write `` Explore Monogamy '' on the leg and back of a model in the video . At the time , Michael had not disclosed his homosexuality , and much of his chart success was based on his sex appeal to young women . His look was raw and provocative , with tight jeans , tight T-shirts , black leather jackets and designer stubble , and his videos pushed the accepted limits with many lingerie-clad models vying for Michael 's attentions on screen . But Michael 's situation changed abruptly in 1998 when he was arrested for lewd conduct in a public toilet in Los Angeles after being spotted by a male undercover police officer . The arrest received international media attention , and seemed for a brief time to jeopardize Michael 's stature as a top recording artist . But instead of making excuses for his behavior , he went on to release a single and video , `` Outside , '' that made light of the charges against him and mocked the Los Angeles police who had arrested him . Like all of his efforts at the time , it sold in prodigious numbers , helping him put the incident behind him . The arrest also prompted him to speak openly about his sexual orientation . These years represented the height of Michael 's commercial success , which at times was marred by a protracted legal dispute with his record company Sony . He remained a strong musical force throughout his career , releasing dozens of records and touring to adoring crowds despite a growing number of run-ins with police , many of them stemming from a series of driving-under-the-influence-of-drugs incidents , including several crashes . Michael was an admitted user of marijuana and prescription sedatives and several times was found slumped over his car 's steering wheel after using both at the same time . His driver 's license was finally revoked for five years in 2010 after Michael drove his Land Rover into the side of a Snappy Snap photo shop with so much force that his vehicle dented the wall . A passer-by remembering Michael 's early career wrote the word WHAM on the spot his SUV had hit . He was also arrested a second time in public toilets -- this time in North London in 2008 for drug use , an incident that prompted him to apologize to his fans and promise to get his life in order . He also offered an apology to `` everybody else , just for boring them . '' A year earlier , he had told a television interviewer that his problems stemmed from a self-destructive streak and his attention-seeking nature . He said at a press conference in 2011 that he felt he had let young people down with his misbehavior and had made it easier for others to denigrate homosexuals . Despite these personal setbacks , Michael 's musical performances remained strong even as his material moved farther from the teen tunes that first brought him to stardom . The Telegraph newspaper in 2011 described a London concert appearance as an impressive event , calling his voice , `` A rich , soulful instrument , it 's capable of serious emotional heft , expertly matching the confessional tone of his own material . '' Michael , with strong Greek-Cypriot roots , was born Georgios Panayiotou in England . He and schoolmate Ridgeley formed a ska band called the Executive when they were just 16 before moving on to form WHAM ! `` I wanted to be loved , '' said Michael of his start in the music field . `` It was an ego satisfaction thing . '' Michael was active in a number of charities and helped raise money to combat AIDS , help needy children , and support gay rights . He had a long-term relationship with Kenny Goss , but announced onstage in August 2011 that the two had broken up . Tags To view our latest e-Edition click the image on the left .

In our weekly series , Yahoo Sport 's Nick Metcalfe features a famous voice of sport . As we look forward to a bumper feast of festive action , presenter John Inverdale goes under the spotlight . This series has featured many famous characters from a bygone era . This week , we profile somebody that has been very much part of our modern sporting lives . If you 've followed sport on radio and television over the past 30 years , there 's no way you will have missed John Inverdale . Whether you 've been tuning into the Olympics , Wimbledon , The Open or Cheltenham , Inverdale has so often been the main man . A great radio operator throughout his career , Inverdale has spent more time on TV as the years have gone on . Whatever the medium , he remains in the very top echelon of contemporary broadcasters , with viewers and listeners everywhere respecting his genuine love of sport and natural authority . It 's no surprise that sport has always been a huge part of Inverdale 's life . He has always enjoyed playing rugby union , and while at university in Southampton , he captained the tennis team . He had his eye on a life in journalism from his early days . He edited the student newspaper during his time on the south coast , before he started his career in print journalism at the Lincolnshire Echo . Radio was n't far behind however , and Inverdale joined BBC Radio Lincolnshire in 1982 . Three years later he began working for national BBC stations . In those days , Radio 2 was the home of sport on the radio . The main Saturday afternoon programme was called Sport on 2 , and was n't dissimilar from the offerings of today , expect there was a little bit less of everything . It began at 1.30 pm , and carried second half commentary of a key football match . Inverdale became the main presenter of the programme , a job he carried on doing for six years . A new station , Radio 5 , went on the air in 1990 , followed in 1994 by 5 Live . But the Saturday programme stayed the same . Inverdale suited it very well , remaining unflappable no matter what the dramas . The main highlights I recall during his time on the programme include the 1991 Rugby World Cup , where England beat old rivals Scotland to reach the final , but lost to Australia in the Twickenham climax . There was also an infamous day in racing history , the 1993 Grand National that had a bungled start and became the `` race that never was '' . And of course there were countless football dramas , as the old Division One made way for the Premier League and the FA Cup continued to throw up its shock results . Inverdale interviews Ryanair CEO Michael O\u2019Leary during the 2015 Cheltenham Festival I 'd argue Inverdale has been the No. 1 voice in radio sport for the last 30 years . I 've always thought it 's his natural home too . The story has it that Jenny Abramsky , the launch controller of 5 Live , was so impressed by his style presenting sport that she tried to incorporate that into all forms of presentation on the new station , including news coverage . She wanted it to be informal and relaxed , but also intelligent . Pure Inverdale in other words . Indeed , Inverdale has always been at home working on news programmes too . He presented the daily drivetime programme Nationwide in those early years of 5 Live , picking up a Sony Broadcaster of the Year award in 1997 . Even to this present day , a good deal of Inverdale 's work is in that cherished old medium . He is the main host of 5 Live 's coverage from the Cheltenham Festival at the start of spring -- which he clearly relishes as a big fan of National Hunt racing -- and leads the BBC radio golf team at both The Open and Ryder Cup . Inverdale just works so well on radio , having a natural warmth and sense of occasion about him . Actually , that 's one of his real strengths . He brings a real gravitas to a major event . When he goes on air at the start of the Cheltenham Festival or Open Championship , he just sells the event so brilliantly . He makes you feel that you want , even need , to spend the next few days enjoying some great sport with the radio team . It 's possibly even fair to say that he set the benchmark for modern presentation , which has now become standard , with the likes of Mark Pougatch and now Mark Chapman following in his footsteps . The Olympic Games has always been a big event for Inverdale , ever since he was part of the Radio 2 team at the 1988 Games in Seoul . I well remember him fronting late night 5 Live coverage during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics . Actually , millions must have shared that Games with him as they headed to bed . After one particularly memorable night of track and field , which featured a 100m final that saw Linford Christie disqualified and Donovan Bailey winning gold -- along with Jonathan Edwards just missing out on triple jump gold -- I recall him saying : `` Sport really is one of the great trivialities , but sometimes , how glorious is it ? '' Rugby union is probably still seen as Inverdale 's main sport . He played at a decent standard for Esher , and has clearly always loved the sport deeply . The World Cups of 1995 in South Africa and 2003 in Australia saw Inverdale in his element as the main presenter for 5 Live . Both tournaments produced unforgettable sporting moments while he was on the air -- South Africa President Nelson Mandela handing the trophy to home captain Francois Pienaar in 1995 and Jonny Wilkinson nervelessly slotting over a last-gasp drop goal to break the hearts of hosts Australia and win the 2003 tournament for England . As the years have gone on , Inverdale has also expanded his television portfolio . In the 1990s , he began presenting a late night discussion and magazine programme , On Side . And today the majority of his year is spent working in front of the camera . His time at the Olympics has now become TV rather than radio based , including presenting BBC coverage of the rowing at the London and Rio Games , which both featured some memorable British gold medals . He also presented the athletics coverage in London , with its many wonderful moments including Mo Farah 's long distance double . Since 2006 , he 's been the main presenter of the BBC 's Six Nations coverage , although these days coverage is shared with ITV . For many years , he fronted the BBC 's daily highlights programme from Wimbledon , before moving to his current role as TV commentator during the SW19 fortnight . Inverdale , who for so long has been associated with the BBC , has moved to the other side too , working for ITV at events like the French Open tennis and the 2015 Rugby World Cup . I always think he 's at his best when he has proper time to settle into an event , and always seems particularly assured and relaxed during the fortnight of ITV coverage from Roland Garros in the spring . It also has to be said that Inverdale has been no stranger to controversy in recent times . He clumsily said this about tennis star Marion Bartoli before her appearance in the 2013 Wimbledon final : `` I just wonder if her dad did say to her when she was 12 , 13 , 14 maybe , ` Listen , you are never going to be , you know , a looker ' . '' Inverdale was accused of being sexist and apologised on air the following day . He also mistakenly swore during radio coverage at Cheltenham , and appeared to have some difficulties working alongside Sir Steve Redgrave at the recent Rio Olympics . The rowing legend rolled his eyes in Inverdale 's direction and shook a wet umbrella over his head . At one stage , there was so much criticism of him that one national newspaper asked earlier this year : `` Why does everyone hate John Inverdale ? '' If you ask me , nearly all that business has been absurdly overblown . Inverdale is still one of the giants of broadcasting . It 's true that he may have the odd clumsy moment , but if you weigh it up against his millions of sensible words , I think he 's still built up plenty of credit in the positive bank . Inverdale shows no signs of stopping . Why should he ? Those big sporting occasions would n't feel quite the same without him . There 's another Cheltenham and Roland Garros coming in the new year , then a Ryder Cup in 2018 , and a Rugby World Cup in 2019 . Inverdale , who turns 60 in 2017 , is still pretty near the top of his game . He has become one of the most famous voices of our sporting times . --", "date": "2016-12-22 19:26:47", "url": "http://ph.sports.yahoo.com/news/voices-of-sport-john-inverdale-the-unflappable-presenter-who-has-been-our-companion-at-the-big-events-for-decades-192647960.html", "phase": "E", "title": "Voices of Sport : John Inverdale - The unflappable presenter who has been our companion at the big events for decades Nick Metcalfe", "names": [{"name": "john inverdale", "ids": ["Q3181808"], "offsets": [[4, 6], [27, 29], [69, 71], [129, 131], [148, 149], [165, 166], [222, 223], [295, 296], [377, 378], [425, 426], [538, 539], [552, 553], [636, 637], [643, 644], [692, 693], [750, 751], [886, 887], [1006, 1007], [1042, 1043], [1114, 1115], [1270, 1271], [1354, 1355], [1422, 1423], [1470, 1471], [1507, 1509], [1525, 1526], [1575, 1576], [1627, 1628]]}, {"name": "jenny abramsky", "ids": ["Q6179140"], "offsets": [[584, 586]]}, {"name": "mark pougatch", "ids": ["Q6769307"], "offsets": [[865, 867]]}, {"name": "mark chapman", "ids": ["Q27524127", "Q27922303", "Q55622208", "Q57053134", "Q57520002", "Q6767044", "Q6767045"], "offsets": [[869, 871]]}, {"name": "linford christie", "ids": ["Q310019"], "offsets": [[954, 956]]}, {"name": "donovan bailey", "ids": ["Q311048"], "offsets": [[958, 960]]}, {"name": "jonathan edwards", "ids": ["Q16213939", "Q18719387", "Q19957695", "Q20656891", "Q22018231", "Q221648", "Q302892", "Q6273021", "Q629737"], "offsets": [[965, 967]]}, {"name": "nelson mandela", "ids": ["Q8023"], "offsets": [[1070, 1072]]}, {"name": "francois pienaar", "ids": ["Q168675"], "offsets": [[1078, 1080]]}, {"name": "jonny wilkinson", "ids": ["Q318920"], "offsets": [[1083, 1085]]}, {"name": "mo farah", "ids": ["Q1671"], "offsets": [[1208, 1210]]}, {"name": "marion bartoli", "ids": ["Q105838"], "offsets": [[1372, 1374]]}, {"name": "steve redgrave", "ids": ["Q52679"], "offsets": [[1455, 1457]]}]}, {"articleID": "2013041222_00073207_W", "content": "steve jobs ' widow is about to step into the national spotlight on immigration us congressman says he intentionally wrote deleted flirty tweets to cyndi lauper as part of a ruse us congressman says he intentionally wrote deleted flirty tweets to cyndi lauper as part of a ruse management consulting ceo : our clients want more than just mbas management consulting ceo : our clients want more than just mbas americans are quitting their jobs at the highest rate in 5 years email sent ! you have successfully emailed the post . north korea risks further isolation with missile launch , john kerry warns sir menzies campbell : political party selection panels are anti-women one icy morning in february , a train pulled into washington dc . it was loaded with environmentalists planning to handcuff themselves to the gates of the white house , in protest at the building of a 3,500 km oil pipeline from canada to the gulf of mexico . amid the hundreds of placard-carrying protesters stood a somewhat incongruous figure in a suit - jeremy grantham , a 74-year-old fund manager . `` what we are trying to do is buy time , '' he told reporters . `` buy time for the world to wake up . '' grantham - who occupies a legendary place in the world of finance for predicting all the major stock market bubbles of recent decades ( and doing very well in the process ) - had decided , after 15 years of low-key environmental philanthropy , to , as he puts it , `` walk the walk '' . `` i was committed to getting arrested , '' says grantham , a tall , slight man , as he looks out across the city from his london office on the 15th floor of a glass-and-steel tower next to the bank of england . he speaks machine gun-quickly in a soft , mid-atlantic accent . `` but the day before [ the protest ] my wife checked with the lawyer , who said , ` do n't do that ! ' '' it turned out that being arrested would give him serious problems when it came to travelling . `` i 've had a green card since completing my mba at harvard in 1964 . '' grantham , co-founder and chief strategist of gmo , a boston-based global investment group , manages $ 106bn ( ? 69bn ) of assets on behalf of 1,000 institutional investors , and employs 600 people , so he decided that the fallout would be too great . he was forced to stand back and watch as his daughter isabel got nasa climate scientist james hansen . so he is speaking out instead . from where he stands , this bubble , the `` carbon bubble '' , is the biggest he 's seen . `` we 're already in a bad place . the worst accidents are [ only ] 20 , 30 , 40 years from now . '' such apocalyptic talk is often the preserve of deep-green doom-mongers - the kind of talk that has led many to reject environmentalism . but grantham insists he 's guided `` by the facts alone '' . on some issues ( immigration and education ) he `` would be considered rightwing '' , but with the environment , he says he calls it as he sees it . he is disdainful of those who ignore the data , or worse , misinform the public . `` i find the parallels between how some investors refuse to recognise trends , and our reaction to some of our environmental challenges , very powerful , '' he says . `` there is an unwillingness to process unpleasant data . in a bull market you want to believe good news . you do n't want to hear that the market is going to go off a cliff . '' he finds climate sceptics - led by a `` little army of non-scientific , persuasive loony lords '' , as he characterises them ( a barely disguised reference to the former conservative chancellor lord lawson and ukip 's lord monckton , both of whom promote , to varying degrees , climate-sceptic views ) - a frustrating ideological phenomenon . `` they have profound beliefs - as opposed to knowledge - that they are willing to protect by all manner of psychological tricks . so you have people who are very smart - great analysts and hedge-fund managers - who on paper know that their argument is wrong , but who promote it fiercely because they are libertarians . anyone with a brain knows that climate change needs governmental leadership , and they can smell this is bad news for their philosophy . they are using incredible ingenuity to steer their way around facts they do not choose to accept . '' grantham , who was born in doncaster and raised a quaker , freely admits to being a `` late arrival to all this '' . after completing a degree in economics at the university of sheffield in the early 1960s , he worked for a short stint at shell before going to harvard for an mba . in 1977 , he co-founded gmo [ grantham , mayo , van otterloo ] . making his clients - and himself - wealthy filled his working days until the mid-1990s . and then he went on holiday with his children , to the amazon . `` and without thinking about it , you start talking about the logs along the side of the river and the lack of mature forests in borneo . '' he smiles , seeing the risk of being accused of being driven by emotion rather than rigorous statistical analysis . `` that played a role , but we did n't treat it as an epiphany . '' and he did n't preach . for years he has remained , oz-like , behind the curtain of the environmental movement . he has shunned in-depth interviews and expressed his views only in quarterly newsletters published on gmo 's website , where he writes of long-term risk , climate change and dwindling resources - not just oil , coal and natural gas , but also phosphorus and potash , whose use in modern farming methods `` must be drastically reduced in the next 20-40 years or we will begin to starve '' . at the same time , he has poured an ever-larger amount of his personal wealth into his grantham foundation for the protection of the environment , which he runs , with family input ( his children are trustees ) and minimal staff , out of gmo 's boston headquarters . the foundation 's latest tax filing shows that in 2011 he increased the fund 's coffers by $ 46m ( ? 30m ) , bringing the total to something approaching $ 400m ( ? 260m ) , up from $ 106m in 2006 . ever the wise moneyman , he has largely reinvested this money , in order to guarantee the foundation 's long-term security . but he also spends around $ 17m annually on his chosen causes , in the process becoming , according to one magazine , the `` world 's most powerful environmentalist '' . run your finger down the tax document and you see why . in 2011 alone , his foundation gave $ 1m to each of the leading us conservation charities , the sierra club and nature conservancy , as well as $ 2m to the environmental defense fund , where his german-born wife hannelore is a trustee and where isabel has also worked . he is perhaps best known in the green world for funding the london school of economics ' grantham research institute on climate change and the environment ( $ 2.2 m in 2011 ) , and imperial college london 's grantham institute for climate change ( $ 1.9 m in 2011 ) , but he funds climate researchers in india , too . he has written large cheques for the carnegie institute of science , the smithsonian , 350 . org , wwf , greenpeace and , keen to counter what he calls the `` misinformation machine '' , funds environmental journalism at yale forum on climate change & the media . until last year ( when he decided investigative and environmental journalism was `` dying out '' due to cutbacks ) , he funded the world 's most lucrative journalism award , the annual $ 80,000 grantham prize for environmental reporting . in the past few months , however , there has been a conspicuous gear-shift in his activities . in addition to being more outspoken , he intends to support new research initiatives , particularly into `` avant garde , sustainable '' farming techniques . he talks of a `` hybrid '' form of farming that takes the best of organic farming and the best from `` big ag '' . he does n't rule out `` compromises '' such as genetic modification , which some environmentalists will find hard to swallow . having said that , his interest is n't entirely selfless . `` fifteen years ago , we started a forestry division [ at gmo ] because i had fallen in love with land and trees , and because i realised it was a mispriced asset class . we have done extremely well in that sector , outperforming the benchmark for 15 years . '' many deep-greens - who claim the root cause for our environmental woes is the slavish quest for economic growth - will recoil at the thought of a hard-boiled capitalist such as grantham underpinning so much of the environmental movement . he is unconcerned . `` capitalism does millions of things better than the alternatives . it balances supply and demand in an elegant way that central planning has never come close to . however , it is totally ill-equipped to deal with a small handful of issues . unfortunately , they are the issues that are absolutely central to our long-term wellbeing and even survival . '' more awkwardly , he insists his substantial investments in oil and gas do n't contradict his green views . `` we need oil . if we took oil away tomorrow , civilisation ends . we can burn all the cheap , high-quality oil and gas , but if we mean to burn all the coal and any appreciable percentage of the tar sands , or even third-derivative , energy-intensive oil and gas , with ` fracking ' for shale gas on the boundary , then we 're cooked , we 're done for . '' he does think there 's some cause for hope . for example , `` the business mathematics of alternative energy are changing much faster [ than many people ] realise . '' looming carbon taxes ( `` hopefully , in the not-too-distant future '' ) , coupled with the increasing affordability of alternative energy , will mean that coal and oil from tar sands run the `` very substantial risk of being stranded assets '' . there there 's the `` amazing '' fall in fertility rates across the world ( `` the absolute minimum hope of survival is a gracefully declining population '' ) . but `` china is my secret weapon , '' he says enthusiastically . his eyes widen with excitement , and he talks quicker and quicker . `` the chinese cavalry riding to the rescue . i have very high hopes for china because they have embedded high scientific capabilities in their leadership class . they know this is serious . and they are acting much faster now than we are . they have it within their capabilities to come back in 30 years with the guarantee of complete energy independence - all alternative and sustainable for ever . they have an embarrassment of capital . we have an embarrassment of debt . so they can set a stunning pace , which they are doing . and they could crank it up . to hell with their five-year plans , they should move up to 25-year plans . they would have such low-cost energy at the end of it they 'd be the terror of the capitalist system . low energy and low labour , that 's the ball game .

Continue Reading Below Wynn accuses defendant Jorgen Nielsen of malice for quotes reported by the Wall Street Journal and ABC News that the lawsuit says left a false and defamatory impression `` that Mr. Wynn is a sexual predator who used his power over decades to coerce or pressure various women into non-consensual sexual conduct . '' Nielsen declined Monday to comment when reached by telephone about the lawsuit filed Thursday in state court in Las Vegas . His attorneys did not immediately respond to telephone and email messages . Nielsen was salon director at several hotels developed and built by Wynn , including Bellagio , Wynn Las Vegas and Encore . Nielsen told the Journal that he and other employees informed company executives about sexual advances by Wynn , but no action was taken . Wynn denies the allegations . In a statement Monday , his attorney Lin Wood referred to a `` media frenzy '' surrounding the initial reporting of accusations against Wynn . Wood noted that the filing against Nielsen was the third defamation lawsuit by Wynn recent weeks . Advertisement The statement said Wynn does not wish to prosecute the lawsuits in the media but does `` seek to hold the defendants accountable for the accusations they made against him . '' A separate Wynn filing in federal court in Las Vegas accuses lawyer Lisa Bloom , representing a dancer in a show at Wynn Las Vegas , of defaming Wynn with allegations of inappropriate behavior . Bloom said she 'll fight Wynn in court and believes the lawsuit was an attempt to intimidate other women . Two massage therapists and a manicurist have in recent months sued Wynn , accusing him of using his power to coerce them into sexual acts . Wynn has filed a defamation lawsuit against The Associated Press for its reporting on a separate allegation made to Las Vegas police . Wynn 's lawsuit against Nielsen accuses him of `` smearing Mr. Wynn ... at a time when he was embroiled in highly contentious and public litigation with his ex-wife , Elaine Wynn . '' The Journal reported that several women said Wynn harassed or assaulted them and one case led to a $ 7.5 million settlement . The newspaper quoted Steve Wynn saying the idea that he had assaulted any woman was `` preposterous . '' Wynn has resigned as chairman and CEO of the company that bears his name and sold his company shares . He reached a $ 25 million settlement with Elaine Wynn , ending a boardroom battle that started in 2012 between Steve Wynn and a former business partner .", "date": "2018-04-30 00:00:00", "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/markets/wynn-sues-ex-salon-chief-quoted-in-sexual-conduct-stories", "phase": "E", "title": "Wynn sues ex-salon chief quoted in sexual conduct stories", "names": [{"name": "steve wynn", "ids": ["Q323739", "Q524369"], "offsets": [[8, 10], [418, 420], [474, 476]]}, {"name": "elaine wynn", "ids": ["Q19518082"], "offsets": [[18, 19], [36, 37], [41, 42], [72, 73], [139, 140], [144, 145], [166, 167], [174, 175], [202, 203], [217, 218], [225, 226], [256, 257], [276, 277], [282, 283], [294, 295], [320, 321], [335, 336], [358, 359], [369, 370], [388, 390], [399, 400], [434, 435], [462, 464]]}, {"name": "jorgen nielsen", "ids": ["Q41763178"], "offsets": [[44, 46], [95, 96], [128, 129], [150, 151], [210, 211], [362, 363]]}, {"name": "lisa bloom", "ids": ["Q6557825"], "offsets": [[266, 268], [289, 290]]}]}, {"articleID": "2017121914_00411516_W", "content": "15 Fantasy Football Transactions for Week 16 Keelan Cole has scored in three straight games . Could he do it again in Week 16 ? I get things wrong all the time . If you 've read this column this year , you know that . If you read this column last year , you know that . And the year before that . And the year before that . Understanding that you 're going to be wrong in fantasy football , though , is the first step in being a better fantasy football player . It forces you to cover your own ass throughout a season . You make more rational moves , and you plan for the inevitable , `` Oh , so Corey Davis actually wo n't be usable down the stretch '' circumstances . My goal with 15 Transactions each week is to , of course , provide actionable information that you can use to win your fantasy football league . But , just as importantly , it 's to open your mind to seeing that this is a process-over-results game , and as long as your logic and reasoning was sound , you still win . OK , OK , I still want you to win your freaking fantasy football championship . If you 're playing for one this week , here are 15 moves -- with a focus on just adds and drops -- that can help put you over the top . Oh , and while you read this last one of the year , I do have one request : do it while listening to Boyz II Men 's . It 's tradition . End of the Road Thanks for another great season . Add Mike Gillislee Hey , remember this guy ? Mike Gillislee 's been a healthy scratch for a month and a half now , but he should be dressed in Week 16 thanks to an injury to Rex Burkhead . While Dion Lewis will more than likely shoulder the load , Gillislee may end up seeing goal-line looks , as he did early in the season . The Patriots have n't used Gillislee since Week 8 , and they had a bye in Week 9 . But since Week 10 , only Mark Ingram and Jonathan Stewart have more carries from within the opponent 's five-yard line than Burkhead ( seven ) does , and Dion Lewis has only one of those types of touches . Meaning , they have n't exactly trusted Lewis close to the goal line . In a game this week with the potential for a positive game script ( New England 's at home against Buffalo -- who entered Week 15 with numberFire 's worst schedule-adjusted rush defense -- as 12.5-point favorites ) , Gillislee could see some work . And we 've got the narrative going , as he 'll be facing his former team . Drop Alfred Morris This transaction is here for two reasons . First , it 's a reminder that Ezekiel Elliott 's suspension is over , which makes Alfred Morris pretty irrelevant in fantasy football . Second , it 's a reminder that worthless fantasy football assets -- players who you wo n't use and your opponent wo n't use -- can be sent to the waiver wire . Though Morris played well in relief of Zeke , he wo n't provide lots of fantasy points in Week 16 . Add Kendall Wright Over the last two weeks , Mitchell Trubisky 's thrown the ball 78 times , averaging 292.50 passing yards per contest . Kendall Wright 's seen 24 of those 78 passes , which is good for a legitimately elite 30.77 % target share in the Bears ' offense . Wright has n't found the end zone , but he 's tallied close to 200 yards on 17 receptions over this two-game span . And during this time , he 's played in the slot on about 64 % of his snaps , per Pro Football Focus . That makes for an interesting matchup against Cleveland this week : the Browns have allowed six top-10 wide receiver performances this year ( PPR ) , and four of those six players ( Keenan Allen , Golden Tate , Adam Thielen , T.Y. Hilton ) ran at least 30 % of their routes from the slot , with three of them hitting at least the 40 % mark . Given Wright 's surge in volume , he makes for a really interesting play and is n't a bad fill-in for Antonio Brown owners . Add Blake Bortles Blake Bortles is still available in about half of Yahoo ! leagues , and after balling out in Week 15 , he 's got an opportunity to do the same in Week 16 . The 49ers , his opponent , are allowing the third-most fantasy points per game to opposing passers , and our numbers have them as a bottom-five secondary when adjusted for strength of opponent . We ca n't ignore that Bortles has played really well over his last three contests , too , with an 8.83 yards per attempt rate in Week 13 , a 9.93 one in Week 14 , and an 11.24 rate this past week . And despite being on the road , the Jaguars are still five-point favorites . Bortles should , logically , give you a decent performance this week . Add Keelan Cole Keelan Cole has been a beneficiary of Bortles ' strong play over the last three weeks , scoring a tuddy in each of these contests . His volume had n't really been there with three targets in Week 13 and three more in Week 14 , but that jumped to nine in Week 15 , partially due to Marqise Lee 's early-game injury . With Lee looking doubtful for Week 16 , Cole could continue to see volume in the aforementioned plus matchup versus the 49ers . Add Kerwynn Williams Is Kerwynn Williams going to win you a fantasy football title ? Probably not . But maybe you 're hurting at running back and somehow , some way made it to the fantasy football championship . If so , Williams is a target off the waiver wire after seeing 53 carries and 60.92 % of Arizona 's rushes over the last three weeks . He 's got a plus matchup against the Giants this week , too -- the Cardinals are at home , they 're favorites , and the G-Men have allowed the sixth-most fantasy points to the running back position this year . Drop Jimmy Garoppolo I 'm a fan of Jimmy Garoppolo and what 's he 's been doing with San Francisco , but he 's a tough passer to trust in Week 16 . Because Jacksonville 's in town . The Jags have surrendered just one QB1 performance this year -- it was to Russell Wilson a couple of weeks ago -- and Wilson had two touchdowns in that game that were 60-plus yards . That 's not exactly sustainable . Garoppolo should have more than the two touchdowns he has over his three San Francisco starts given his yardage totals , but Jacksonville 's allowed more than 250 passing yards only twice this year . And since Week 9 , per Rotoworld 's Rich Hribar , the Jags have n't even allowed a red zone touchdown . That , unfortunately , makes Jimmy G a drop candidate , since this is the last week of the fantasy football season . Add Nick Foles Before Carson Wentz 's season-ending knee injury , he had a fairly unsustainable 7.50 % touchdown rate ( touchdowns per attempt ) that was bound to regress a bit . So when Nick Foles stepped into the offense this past weekend , the thought was , `` This matchup is right , and he 's a viable streaming option , but let 's not assume he 's able to maintain such scoring efficiency . '' What did Foles do ? He threw 4 touchdowns on 38 attempts . Again , this is n't sustainable production by any means , but he 's in a good spot once again in Week 16 as he 'll face the Raiders , a squad with a bottom-five secondary , per our opponent-adjusted metrics . Add Charles Clay Tyrod Taylor was under center for the Bills again in Week 15 , and he ended up targeting Charles Clay on 9 of his 29 passes . If that type of target share ( 31.03 % ) comes close to repeating itself in Week 16 , Clay will make for a strong streaming option versus New England , especially because there could be a lot of passes thrown from Taylor if and when the Bills lose a lead in the game . They are , as mentioned earlier , 12.5-point underdogs in the contest , after all . Drop Ameer Abdullah Maybe the Lions are playing it slow with Ameer Abdullah after he missed Weeks 13 and 14 with a neck injury . But he was active in Week 15 and played just 13 % of Detroit 's snaps , seeing 1 of a possible 19 running back carries for the Lions . There 's no way you can confidently trust his usage going into Week 16 , no matter the matchup he 's facing . If he goes off , he goes off -- you 're making the right choice by freeing up a space on your roster this week for someone else . Add Joe Flacco Did you see what Brock Osweiler did to the banged-up Colts secondary on Thursday ? Well , in case you missed it , he entered the game for an injured Trevor Siemian and finished as a high-end QB1 in fantasy football . Brock Osweiler . Off the bench . QB1 . Real life . Enter Joe Flacco , who 's facing that same Colts bottom-ranked secondary in Week 16 . Like Bortles , Flacco 's seen a three-game stretch of decent quarterback play ( Bortles ' has been better ) , throwing for 5 touchdowns and more than 270 yards per game over his last three contests . The Colts have given up a top-15 quarterback performance in all but four games this year , and Flacco will be at home as a huge 13.5-point favorite . That gives the Ravens a nice implied team total on the week , which should increase your confidence in playing someone as mediocre as Flacco as a quarterback streamer in the finals . Add Mike Wallace Mike Wallace actually has a target share north of 20 % over Baltimore 's last three games , and he 's tallied almost 34 % of the team 's receiving yards over this time . He 's been a strong asset , but we have n't cared enough about him in fantasy because he has n't found the end zone . That could change in Week 16 , though , as Indianapolis has allowed the second-most points per game to the wide receiver position this year . You just have to hope that target share holds up and that Colts ' cornerback Rashaan Melvin ca n't get back on the field this week . Add Travis Benjamin and Tyrell Williams We have n't learned a whole lot about a back injury that put Keenan Allen onto a cart in Week 15 , but there 's some speculation that it 's not all that serious . That would be good news . Even still , in fantasy football , we 've got to assume the worst in order to plan properly . If Allen , for whatever reason , misses Week 16 , we should expect his 27.51 % target share to be dispersed across the offense , with Travis Benjamin and Tyrell Williams as the main beneficiaries . The Chargers get a nice matchup against a bottom-10 Jets secondary this week , too . Add the Chicago Bears ' Defense Really , I just want to write `` the Bears are facing the Browns , '' but that wo n't be enough , even though it probably should be at this point . Cleveland 's allowing an average of 3.07 sacks and 1.79 interceptions per contest this year , while scoring fewer than 15 points per game . It 's the worst offense in football , and it 's surrendering the most fantasy points to opposing defenses . And , this week , the Bears are in Chicago as 6.5-point favorites . They 're a perfect streaming option . Add the Arizona Cardinals ' Defense The Giants looked fairly competent offensively in Week 15 against the Eagles , but they 'll be traveling to Arizona this week to take on the Cardinals as 4.5-point underdogs .

Monday marks the official end of the U.S. government 's net neutrality rules , which had required broadband providers such as AT&T , Charter , Comcast and Verizon to treat all Web traffic equally . The repeal is part of a campaign by Ajit Pai , the Republican chairman of the Federal Communications Commission , to deregulate the telecom industry in a bid to boost its investments -- particularly in rural areas . `` I think ultimately it 's going to mean better , faster , cheaper Internet access and more competition , '' Pai said in an interview . Others disagree and will challenge Pai in court , while many states are fighting back with their own laws , further muddling the situation . One day after the net neutrality changes , a federal judge is set to rule on Tuesday on whether AT&T can buy Time Warner .

Billy Preston had just arrived at the Intensive Care Unit at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital in Marina del Rey , rushed there from the Canyon , a nearby drug-rehab center . A large , frustrated nurse wrestled with the legendary , 59-year-old organ player , struggling to fit a black oxygen mask over his face . Eyes wide with fear , Preston dodged his head back and forth , unable to breathe . Holding his hand at his bedside was Preston 's manager , Joyce Moore . She tried in vain to calm him down . `` I gripped him tight and said , ` Boo , you got ta relax , ' '' Moore says . `` I thought he was having a panic attack . I kept saying , ` Breathe with me ... breathe with me . ' '' But it was n't a panic attack or the pangs of crack withdrawal . Years of drug abuse had culminated in malignant hypertension and pericarditis , the internal drowning of the area around Preston 's heart . He mustered the strength to push the mask away , look up at Moore and painfully utter his last words : `` I ... ca n't ! '' Suddenly Preston 's eyes rolled back , and his grip loosened . The monitors flatlined . Even after doctors drained the fluid around his heart , he did n't wake up . He lay in a coma for nearly six months before dying on June 6 , 2006 . The loss is a nightmare that Moore 's mind refuses to erase . `` I feel like Billy 's sitting here . It 's weird ... He never leaves , '' says the spindly , silver-haired 69-year-old . `` It 's not a physical presence , more like a conscience thing . '' Producing a string of acclaimed albums and hits through the 1960s and '70s , Preston 's talent is knitted into the fabric of rock & roll , soul , gospel , and funk . In life , his talent defied gravity . The same goes for the financial mess that has followed his death . On a recent Tuesday night , Moore , dressed in a black-and-white-striped cardigan , sits in an empty restaurant inside a Costa Mesa hotel . There 's barely room for food on the table , which is covered in court documents , the earthly remnants of Preston 's ghost . They 're pieces of the musician 's tangled , now-long-posthumous bankruptcy case , originally filed in 2005 . For nearly a decade , Moore has waged a quixotic battle with bankruptcy trustee lawyers in Santa Ana 's Ronald Reagan Federal Building and Courthouse . Besides settling what the bankruptcy trustee believes to be Preston 's $ 4 million debt , there 's the fight over money gained from Preston 's intellectual property and royalties from Preston Music Group Inc. ( PMGI ) , of which Moore is the CEO . Decades later , Preston 's soulful classics -- including `` Nothing From Nothing , '' `` Will It Go Round in Circles '' and `` That 's the Way God Planned It '' -- sadly describe the legal battle that has followed his death . Accusations of misconduct have been leveled by both sides of the case . The bankruptcy trustee 's lawyers accuse Moore of using Preston 's royalties for her own financial gain , not paying his debts and refusing to disclose the financial records of PMGI . In the media , she 's been accused of isolating Preston from his family in life and hoarding his money in death . Moore insists the bankruptcy trustee has no right to go after intellectual property as part of the delinquency of Preston 's estate and that the entire case itself is a fraud . The war has put a hold on concerts , tours and projects done in the artist 's memory -- in other words , it kills any and all projects that might create revenue to pay off his creditors .", "date": "2015-01-22 01:17:06", "url": "http://blogs.ocweekly.com/heardmentality/2015/01/the_quiet_battle_for_the_soul_of_billy_preston_is_being_fought_in_a_santa_ana_courtroom.php", "phase": "E", "title": "The Soul of Billy Preston is Being Fought Over in a Santa Ana Courtroom | OC Weekly", "names": [{"name": "billy preston", "ids": ["Q39070583"], "offsets": [[40, 42], [101, 102], [120, 121], [215, 216], [248, 249], [313, 314], [363, 364], [450, 451], [507, 508], [522, 523], [529, 530], [547, 548], [611, 612], [644, 645], [676, 677]]}, {"name": "daniel freeman", "ids": ["Q18149703", "Q39051822", "Q42157784"], "offsets": [[51, 53]]}]}, {"articleID": "2017100412_00612899_W", "content": "Sean Baker 's `` The Florida Project '' Finds Bright , Lively Beauty in Growing Up Broke Combined Shape In `` The Florida Project , '' Bria Vinaite ( left ) and Brooklynn Prince play a mother and daughter who are creating their own fantasy world while living in the Magic Kingdom Motel . Marc Schmid/Courtesy A24 Filmmaking is not a poor man 's game . Even as digital cameras get cheaper , making a film worthy of release still requires dough to get off the ground , which means the folks who tell stories through cinema tend to come from backgrounds of privilege . That breeds movies aimed at middle - to upper-class people , about middle - to upper-class people . Even when independent filmmakers attempt to tell stories `` authentic '' to those millions of Americans who live below the poverty line , the filmmakers inevitably get it wrong . They too often focus on the tragedy of being broke , so the audience can proclaim , `` Oh , those poor unfortunate souls ! '' -- it can become a sort of poverty torture porn . News flash : Even those living paycheck to paycheck manage to have some fun , and I might venture to say that they 're maybe more creative with that fun because they have to make it without money . Sean Baker is one of the few filmmakers working today who gets that it 's possible to find joy in small , difficult corners of the world . His film Tangerine , about two transwomen and their hilarious exploits across Los Angeles , does n't bow to typical expectations of media featuring transpeople , where their gender identity is always a tragedy and the focus of the story . Sure , Tangerine 's characters are poor , and one 's fresh out of jail . But the small pleasures of a delicious donut can give them the energy to power through any day . That Baker made that gem of a film with a hundred grand and an iPhone camera is fitting ; the director merrily ragtags his way through film production much like his characters do through their lives . And with The Florida Project , his follow-up to Tangerine , Baker again grants both humanity and humor to his down-on-their-luck subjects , only maybe with a little bit of a bigger budget this time and a real camera . Little Moonee ( Brooklynn Prince ) lives with her smack-talking , tatted young mom , Halley ( Bria Vinaite ) , in the Magic Kingdom Motel , walking distance from the throngs of crowds that flock to Disney World year-round . Moonee romps around the `` neighborhood '' ( really just a motel-dotted track of interstate ) with her little pals , Scooty ( Christopher Rivera ) and Jancey ( Valeria Cotto ) , getting into trouble wherever they can , while motel manager Bobby ( Willem Dafoe ) plays the Mr. Wilson to their collective Dennis the Menace . The story does n't take the usual turns but is rather a slice of life that culminates with the outside world encroaching on the little fantasy Moonee and Halley have built . We know that Halley 's nights out drinking and her unemployment may not be building toward a happy ending , but this is a story seen through Moonee 's eyes . She believes that as long as you 're clever and cute enough , you can scheme your way out of anything . It 's glorious fun watching Moonee and her buds face boredom and heat . They lean against a stucco wall mural in a parking lot with nothing at all to do . Eventually , Moonee bangs her head against the wall . Then again . Then Scooty does it , too . And then they 're passing the time banging their heads against the wall like little devils . In another scene , Baker frames Moonee and Scooty in close-up as they trade licks on a fast-melting soft-serve cone . Their eyes are taunting and fiendish . When a drip of ice cream hits the floor , the camera reveals Bobby there , staring at the kids , waiting for the moment he can kick them out of the motel lobby . `` I said , ` One drip , and you 're out ! ' '' he yells . Dafoe 's character , the guy who 's too nice for his own good , becomes something of a father to these volatile children and Halley , resulting in some explosively funny scenes . Through the rundown buildings where Moonee and her buds play , Baker captures the vibrancy of Florida . Wizard Gift Shop is shaped like a giant wizard . Orange World looks like a big , bright orange . And Twisted Treat is an ice cream stand resembling , you guessed it , a giant ice cream cone . This is a kitschy world built for tourists , but Moonee and her mom ai n't visitors . And Moonee , for all her churlishness , is a sophisticated thinker who seems to understand her station in life enough to adapt . She and her little buds are n't simply precocious pranksters ; they are full human beings with hopes and fears and coping mechanisms . Though Moonee 's story may not have a Hollywood happy ending when she 's grown and the world has been cruel , Baker has created an indomitable character who 's at least got a fighting chance .

Prosecutors are expected to read a transcript of the 2005 testimony as early as Wednesday , saving for the very end of their case Cosby 's own words about using the 1970s party drug `` the same as a person would say , ` Have a drink . ' '' `` Quaaludes happen to be the drug that kids , young people were using to party with , and there were times when I wanted to have them just in case , '' Cosby testified in the deposition , given as part of a lawsuit chief accuser Andrea Constand filed against him . Cosby settled the lawsuit in 2006 for nearly $ 3.4 million . Cosby , now 80 , said in the deposition that he obtained seven prescriptions for quaaludes from his doctor in Los Angeles in the 1970s , ostensibly for a sore back . The drug was banned in the U.S. in 1982 , the same year one of the women who testified , Janice Baker-Kinney , alleges Cosby knocked her out with pills she suspected to be quaaludes and then raped her . Judge Steven O'Neill waited until Tuesday to rule that prosecutors could have the `` Cosby Show '' star 's deposition testimony read into the record , handing the prosecution a key victory in its effort to portray the comedian as a serial predator . Prosecutors unleashed other passages from Cosby 's graphic deposition , including his accounts of sexual encounters with Constand and how he apologized to her mother a year later for being `` a dirty old man with a young girl . '' They used another of Cosby 's statements , one he gave to police in 2005 , to show how he described the encounter for which he is facing aggravated indecent assault charges that could send him to prison for years . Cosby said he gave Constand 1\u00a01/2 tablets of the cold and allergy medicine Benadryl to help her relax , then fondled her breasts and genitals , according to the police transcript , which also was read to the jury on Tuesday . Cosby said Constand never told him to stop and has maintained that the encounter was consensual . `` We are petting . I enjoyed it , '' the TV star said , according to the transcript . `` And then I stopped , and I went up to bed . We stopped , and then we talked . '' Constand says Cosby knocked her out with the pills and then sexually assaulted her , penetrating her with his fingers and guiding her hand to his penis . Cosby told police he did n't remember whether Constand touched his genitals . Prosecutors also have several more witnesses to call . They include Judith Regan , who published Cosby accuser Janice Dickinson 's memoir , Constand 's lawyer Bebe Kivitz and a pharmacology expert . Jurors got a sense of Cosby 's view of consent when the comedian described in the deposition testimony reaching an area `` somewhere between permission and rejection '' during what he claims was a prior sexual encounter with Constand . `` I 'm giving Andrea time to say ` yes ' or ` no ' about an area that is right there in the question zone , '' Cosby testified . The unsealing of the deposition , at the request of The Associated Press , led prosecutors to reopen Cosby 's criminal case and shredded his good-guy persona as America 's Dad . Prosecutors won the right to introduce it at his retrial on charges he drugged and molested her at his suburban Philadelphia home . The deposition also was included at Cosby 's first trial , which ended with a hung jury last year . Montgomery County Detective James Reape , who has been working on the Cosby investigation since it was reopened in 2015 , told jurors he was n't concerned about inconsistencies the defense played up in Constand 's story -- such as her early uncertainty over the date of the alleged assault -- because Cosby 's testimony had filled in many of the blanks . `` The defendant said it happened . The defendant said it happened in 2004 . The defendant said he was present . The defendant admitted to the contact that she said happened , '' Reape told jurors . `` When I look at who , what , when , where , why in 2015 , I 'm able to see the answers . '' The Associated Press does n't typically identify people who say they 're victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission , which Constand has done . ___ Follow Mike Sisak at https://twitter.com/mikesisak . ___ For more coverage visit https://www.apnews.com/tag/CosbyonTrial .

Credit : Dmitrii V. Semenok et al. / The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters Scientists from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and Skoltech have demonstrated the high-temperature superconductivity of actinium hydrides and discovered a general principle for calculating the superconductivity of hydrides based on the periodic table alone . The results of their study were published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters . High - temperature superconductivity is a phenomenon of zero electrical resistance in certain materials at temperatures above -196 degrees C ( the temperature of liquid nitrogen ) . Room-temperature superconductors open up prospects for the power industry , transport , and other technology-driven sectors . Currently , the record holder in high-temperature superconductivity is hydrogen sulfide ( H3S ) , which functions as a superconductor at 1.5 million atmospheres and a temperature of -70 degrees C . Such pressure levels can only be attained in a lab environment , and the temperature is way below room temperature , so the search continues for new superconductors . Perhaps an even higher-temperature superconductivity can be attained in metal-hydrogen compounds . Yet the link between chemical composition and superconductivity was unclear , leaving scientists to puzzle out by trial and error . A group of chemists led by Artem R. Oganov , professor at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and Skoltech , discovered that certain elements capable of forming superconducting compounds are arranged in a specific pattern in the periodic table . It was established that high-temperature superconductivity develops in substances containing metal atoms that come close to populating a new electronic subshell . Metal atoms inside the crystal are assumed to become highly sensitive to the positions of the neighboring atoms , which would result in strong electron-phonon interaction , the underlying effect of conventional superconductivity . Based on this assumption , the scientists supposed that high-temperature superconductivity could occur in actinium hydrides . Their supposition was verified and confirmed : superconductivity was predicted for AcH 16 at temperatures of -69 to -22 degrees C at 1.5 million atmospheres . `` The very idea of a connection between superconductivity and the periodic table was first put forward by Dmitry Semenok , a student at my lab . The principle he discovered is very simple and it is really amazing that no one had hit upon it before , '' says Artem Oganov .

'' lopez has a lot to do with why the borough will be hosting its first postseason game since game 7 of the 1956 world series . his consistent production is among the reasons why the nets are hosting their first playoff game since may 18 , 2007 . `` he 's had an all-star year , '' interim head coach p.j. carlesimo said . `` he 's shooting the ball well from the perimeter , he 's finishing inside and he 's getting to the free-throw line . he 's night and day better defensively , in terms of the way he protects the rim . '' so do his teammates think he 'll be ready to step up for the biggest games of his career ? `` hell yeah , '' reggie evans said . evans has been in the league for 11 years and played with big men such as blake griffin , but what he sees from lopez is a work ethic and focus that makes the nets fully trust their 2008 first-round pick . `` brook is showing you everything , '' evans said after thursday 's practice . `` brook 's a whole different person and when i say that , that 's in a good way . nobody is stopping him . the only person that can stop brook is brook , that 's it . brook is on a mission . `` his focus is there . he 's there early on game day . his focus in practice is there . his determination is there . so he 's my least concern in being ready . i 've been kind of prepping him like , ` hey man , the atmosphere is going to be different . ' but he ai n't showing me no signs like he 's not ready . he 's ready to step up to the plate . '' nets playing their best new york giants coach tom coughlin is fond of saying you want to be playing your best entering the playoffs . judging by how the nets finished the regular season , it seems that they are adhering to coughlin 's viewpoint . the nets won six of their last seven games after losing by two to chicago on april 4 . the loss was one of just six the nets had in their last 18 games . `` i think we 've been playing pretty good , '' johnson said . `` the ball has been moving great . guys have been on the same page . at this time of the year when you 're clicking and jelling and that cohesiveness is there , it 's perfect timing for us . so we take some of this momentum into the postseason and try to make something happen . '' in 2006 , the nets won 49 games , the same amount as this year . to reach that point , they peaked in march with a 14-game winning streak and 17 wins in their last 22 games . there was not one moment where everything seemed to click but if there is one key reason it is health . deron williams has been a different player since taking the week before the all-star break off to rest his ankles . joe johnson has better lift in his heel and during the four-game winning streak that locked up the fourth seed , he shot 27-for-58 ( 46.5 percent ) . `` i think everybody is semi-healthy now , '' williams said . `` and for the first time in a long time , we have everybody at full strength . so , we are definitely excited about that and feel confident that when we are playing at our highest level , we are tough to beat . '' williams is so healthy that although the bulls like to slow things down , he said he plans on attempting to push the pace whenever possible . `` we want to get up and down , '' he said . `` i think we have to . we ca n't just let them set up their defense . if we let them get into a half court game , it 's going to be tough . '' looking back at chicago the nets and bulls played four games this season . if you take anything from the regular season into the playoffs , chicago won three of those four . but the four games against the bulls were decided by a combined 21 points and the three losses by the nets have differing characteristics . `` we 've been right there and had opportunities , '' lopez said . `` i think it could easily be 3-1 the other way . it 's going to be physical , but i think we 're ready for it . '' `` that 's going to be a tough series , '' johnson said . `` they 're a hard-nosed team , a blue collar team , hard-working and a great defensive team . so we got to be on our p 's and q 's , hitting on all cylinders . in the playoffs you ca n't take a possession off . '' nobody knows if derrick rose will play and so far , the nets have not practiced anything related to his presence . `` you 're not gon na simulate the things he does , '' carlesimo said . `` he was arguably the best player in the league when he last played , but they play so much quicker when he 's on the floor and they 're so much more disruptive defensively . the things derrick makes happen , you ca n't simulate . '' new atmosphere when the dodgers were making six world series appearances against the yankees from 1947-56 , the raucous atmosphere at ebbets field was highlighted by hilda chester 's cowbell and the dodger `` symphony band . '' the barclays center is located at the site where walter o'malley wanted to build his new stadium and on saturday night , the nets are hoping the atmosphere will be just as noisy , but in a different way . in keeping with the theme of black uniforms and black seats in the building , the team is marketing the playoffs by urging fans by calling it a `` blackout in brooklyn .

Have your say A Sheffield family has given a lasting gift to the community they love . Jonathan Hunt OBE and his family have joined together to set up an Acorn fund , which will grow over the years into a long lasting gift to South Yorkshire and create a legacy for the Hunt family . The Jonathan Hunt Family Acorn Fund has been set up with local charity South Yorkshire 's Community Foundation ( SYCF ) . SYCF specialises in establishing funds with local businesses and philanthropists , which are distributed for the benefit of local communities . Mr Hunt is a former Senior Partner at Wake Smith Solicitors in Sheffield and served as High Sheriff of South Yorkshire in 2007-8 . Mr Hunt has a long history of supporting local charities and is the current Chairman of the South Yorkshire branch of SSAFA , which supports those in the armed forces , veterans and their families . He also gave 10 years of leadership and support as Chairman of South Yorkshire 's Community before retiring from the position in 2014 . Jonathan Hunt said : `` I was Chairman of SYCF for 10 years and during that time I donated to SYCF to help cover the costs of its vital work . `` Now , I wish to continue my support by building a named endowment , with the income supporting need in South Yorkshire for many years to come . `` Setting up an Acorn Fund appealed to us as a family because it meant we could give a meaningful amount , but over time in an affordable way . '' `` I expect Acorn Funds will grow in appeal to those looking to give locally , as it is a simple and effective solution to provide long term support for our county and communities . '' Acorn funds have a target sum , which is achieved through annual donations . The fund then becomes endowed and means that grants from the fund can be given in perpetuity . Mr Hunt continued : `` My wife and I , supported by our sons have established the ` Jonathan Hunt Family Acorn Fund ' and we are excited to witness the impact it will make in our lifetime and comforted , knowing the difference it will make during the lives of generations to come . Mr Hunt and his family are following in the footsteps of another former SYCF Chairman Roy Darlison , who established the very first Acorn Fund with the Foundation . James Newman OBE , Chairman of SYCF and former Chairman of the Sheffield City Region Local Enterprise Partnership ( LEP ) said : `` Jonathan was a dedicated and passionate Chairman . '' He gave so much to the Foundation and to South Yorkshire before retiring from the role . `` For Jonathan and family to set up an Acorn Fund , it shows that supporting local people remains as important as ever to the Hunt family . `` The choice of an Acorn Fund , which will become endowed over time also means that the Hunt family will continue to keep helping the community they love for years to come . It will be a legacy they can pass down through generations . '' SYCF is a key part of the local charity sector and in 30 years has raised and distributed over \u00a3 26m , amounting to over 8,250 grant awards . In 2015-16 , SYCF 's grant awards supported 1 in 10 people across South Yorkshire .

The move has been championed by David Cameron but he has faced Conservative opposition at all levels from the grassroots to the Cabinet . A group of more than 30 current and former local party chairmen warned that the plans would drive Tory voters to the UK Independence Party and make a Conservative election victory in 2015 impossible . Bob Woollard , chairman of the Conservative Grassroots group which organised the protest letter to the Prime Minister said : `` Same sex marriage is really a tipping point , a bellwether issue if you like - people have just said ` I 've had enough , I 'm off , I will never vote Conservative again ' . `` Scores and scores and scores of people that we have all spoken to , probably hundreds of thousands of people have said : ` I 've had enough , that 's it now , we ca n't cope with this so-called modernisation agenda . We are not voting Conservative again until this bill is scrapped , defeated in the House of Lords , kicked into the long grass or until there 's a change of leadership ' . '' But a rival letter , signed by more than 100 Tory activists , called for Conservative MPs to `` deal with the Bill then move on together as a party '' . The Marriage ( Same Sex Couples ) Bill will be debated over two days , with its third reading - the final hurdle in the Commons - tomorrow . Tory former minister Tim Loughton will attempt to amend the legislation to allow heterosexuals to have the same right to civil partnerships as gay couples . He highlighted a ComRes survey of 159 MPs from across the parties which found 73 % agreed that civil partnerships should be extended to heterosexuals `` in the interests of equality '' if gay marriage is legalised . Mr Loughton said : `` Far from being a ` wrecking measure ' some of the strongest support for my amendment to extend civil partnerships comes from the biggest supporters of same sex marriage in the Labour and Lib Dem parties .

( AP ) -- President Donald Trump will not be adding two new lawyers to the legal team defending him in the special counsel 's Russia investigation after all , one of the president 's attorneys said . Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said in a statement Sunday that Washington lawyers Joseph diGenova and Victoria Toensing have conflicts that wo n't allow them to represent the president regarding special counsel Robert Mueller 's investigation . Sekulow had announced diGenova 's appointment last week . Sunday 's announcement came just hours after Trump used Twitter to push back against reports that he 's having difficulty adding to his legal team , saying he was `` very happy '' with his current attorneys . `` Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case , '' he wrote , adding : `` Fame & fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer , though some are conflicted . '' Recommended Video : Now Playing : Trump 's lead attorney on the Russia probe is gone . Trump has denied reports of a legal team shakeup 11 days prior , stating on Twitter , `` The Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out . Wrong . I am VERY happy with my lawyers , John Dowd , Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow . They are doing a great job ... . . '' According to the New York Times , Dowd felt Trump was ignoring his advice , after Trump attacked special council Mueller on Twitter recently . Down took over Trump 's legal team last summer . His work has been questionable in the past , and included a few angry outbursts at the press . Trump recently added Joseph Digenova to his legal team , who has vehemently accused the FBI and DOJ of trying to frame Trump . CNN also reported , `` As the investigation seems to be intensifying , the President , according to multiple sources , is convinced he needs to take the reins of his own legal strategy and Trump has recently pushed to bring new attorneys onto his team . The shift distressed some of his lawyers , namely Dowd , who felt blindsided and insulted by the President 's hire of diGenova and other shifts , privately threatening to quit before ultimately resigning on Thursday , two sources said . '' Media : NowThis News Neither the president nor Sekulow specified the conflict regarding diGenova and Toensing , who are married to each other and law partners , but their firm has represented other clients in the special counsel 's investigation , including former Trump campaign adviser Sam Clovis . Sekulow said Trump was `` disappointed '' that diGenova and Toensing wo n't be defending him in the special counsel investigation , but `` those conflicts do not prevent them from assisting the President in other legal matters . '' `` The President looks forward to working with them , '' he added . On Sunday , diGenova and Toensing released a joint statement , saying , `` We thank the president for his confidence in us , and we look forward to working with him on other matters . '' DiGenova , who provided the statement to The Associated Press , declined to answer additional questions about the nature of his and Toensing 's representation of the president . DiGenova had been expected to usher in a new strategy for the president after Trump 's lead attorney , John Dowd , resigned last week . Dowd had touted the cooperation of the White House and Trump campaign with Mueller . DiGenova , a former U.S. attorney , has been a fierce defender of Trump on television and accused the FBI of trying to `` frame '' the president for nonexistent crimes . Dowd was the primary negotiator and legal strategist who had been putting together the president 's legal defense in the Russia probe led by Mueller . The legal team shake-up also comes as Trump 's attorneys have been negotiating with Mueller over the scope and terms of an interview with the president . Mueller is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether there was any collusion with the Trump campaign . The president tweeted Sunday , `` there was NO COLLUSION with Russia , '' pointing instead to his 2016 Democratic rival , Hillary Clinton . Sen. Mark Warner , D-Va . , said on NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' that the Russians hacked into the election and every one of the president 's top security advisers has said they 'll be back . But he said the White House is providing no direction on making election security a top priority . Warner was asked if the president is acting like he has been `` compromised '' when it comes to Russian President Vladimir Putin . Trump congratulated Putin on his re-election last week and failed to bring up the U.S. election meddling or the poisoning of a former Russian spy on British soil during the conversation . `` It 's more than bizarre that 14 months into this president 's administration , he has failed to ever call out Russia . He has failed to ever condemn Putin , '' said Warner , the leading Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee . `` There is something just strange about this , and I think it 's one of the reasons why Mueller 's investigation has to continue and why our investigation has to continue .

'' working with other non-governmental organisations , the enough project has spent the last year researching the supply chains that link these conflict minerals to many of the world 's most demanded electronics , including cell phones , portable music players and computers . drc has suffered from violence brought on by the `` resource curse '' for well over a century . over the past decade , various militias and military units that have dominated conflict-ridden areas of the country have vied for control of mineral-rich areas and their inhabitants in part by using sexual violence . according to the study , 1,100 rape cases are reported each month , the world 's highest rate of sexual violence against women and girls . `` women from communities that are being displaced are sometimes so traumatized by the sexual violence that they will never return to their home areas , '' wrote john prendergast , co-founder of enough , in a recent editorial in the san francisco chronicle . `` these crimes destroy families , decimate communities , and lethally spread hiv/aids and other sexually transmitted diseases . '' years of unrest have plagued the region . following the 1994 genocide in rwanda , in which some 800,000 ethnic tutsis and moderate hutus were slaughtered by government forces and government-backed militias , hundreds of thousands of hutus associated with the regime fled across the border into the drc , as the tutsi-led rwandan patriotic front ( rpf ) conquered the country . while many have since returned to rwanda , the continued presence of `` genocidaires '' in eastern congo has been cited by kigali as justification for repeated incursion by its forces over the past 12 years into the region . indeed , the new study was released as oxfam reported wednesday that some 250,000 people in the drc have been displaced following an unprecedented joint operation by rwanda and the drc 's own army against the remnants of the hutu forces earlier this year . while the operation was hailed as a success by the two countries , the withdrawal of rwandan forces over the past several weeks has enabled the hutu militias to return to the region where they have carried out a campaign of looting and terror against the local population . oxfam said that congolese soldiers have also engaged in the violence . `` there is widespread looting , burning of villages and an unacceptable peak of sexual violence , '' marcel stoessel , oxfam 's country director in dr congo , told the bbc . according to the enough study , the three main armed groups responsible for the violence and who also control much of the mineral trade are the national congress for the defense of the people ( cndp ) , the democratic liberation forces of rwanda ( fdlr ) and renegade units of the congolese army ( fardc ) . these armed groups profit from the mineral trade by forcibly controlling the mines and exacting bribes , or taxes , from transporters , local and international buyers and border controls . the conflict minerals - tin , tantalum , tungsten and gold - are moved from congo to countries in east asia where they are processed into valuable metals needed for the manufacture of a wide range of electronics products . the biggest use of tin worldwide is in electronic products , as a solder on circuit boards . congolese armed groups earn approximately 85 million dollars a year from trade in tin , according to the paper . trade in tantalum , which is used to store electricity in capacitors in ipods , digital cameras , and cell phones earns the armed groups an estimated 8 million dollars annually . tungsten , used to make cell phones vibrate , earns approximately 2 million dollars a year ; and gold , used in jewelry and as a component in electronics , provides from 44 million dollars to 88 million dollars a year . enough called for electronics companies to endorse a pledge - similar to that made by the diamond and jewelry industry seven years ago regarding so-called `` blood diamonds '' - that they will manufacture their products without conflict minerals and make their supply chains subject to a transparent audit to back up the pledge . according to the report , companies such as apple , nokia , hewlett packard , and nintendo should `` change their procurement practices and demand that their suppliers provide proof of where their minerals are sourced from . '' enough also urged consumers around the world to use their purchasing power by demanding that companies examine their business practices and become accountable for the sources of minerals used in many of their products `` we 're asking consumers to endorse the conflict minerals pledge and contact the 21 leading electronics companies through our raise hope for congo website to build pressure on these companies to make their products conflict-free , '' said prendergast . the paper also asks that u.s. president barack obama and congress take concrete steps to ensure the end of violence in the drc by combating its causes . `` president obama must make a clean break with past policy toward congo , which has too often been designed to half-heartedly manage the symptoms of the crisis through humanitarian aid , erratic diplomacy , and peacekeeping assistance , '' according to prendergast . he called for obama to name a high-level special envoy with a team that can work in co-ordination with others on the local , national , and regional sources of instability ; provide all necessary support to the international criminal court as it attempts to investigate and prosecute war crimes in the drc , and press for making rape as a weapon of war a primary focus of criminal investigations in the eastern part of the country . enough also urged congress to introduce legislation `` that requires companies to disclose where their minerals are sourced , and creates penalties for those who continue purchasing conflict minerals .

Here 's why a fraction will cost nearly that John Tuohy Indianapolis Star Published 6:00 AM EDT Sep 24 , 2018 Nickel Plate Trail at 116th Steet Submitted by Fishers As Fishers begins designing its stretch of the Nickel Plate Trail , the estimated cost of the greenway to be built in partnership with Noblesville is climbing , prompting some trail opponents to allege taxpayers were duped . Fishers is budgeting $ 7 million to $ 9 million for construction of the first , 2-mile-long leg of the trail , a bill that comes close to the $ 9.3 million officials estimated for the whole 9-mile trail when plans were announced more than 1-1/2 years ago . The decision to build a tunnel or bridge , though likely the former , at 116th Street is a big reason for the sudden price bump . The passage will allow trail users to cross the busy street without stopping traffic . Fishers spokeswoman Ashley Elrod said the original $ 9.3 million estimate anticipated only the cost of laying down the concrete and asphalt for the trail path that will replace tracks in the Nickel Plate Rail corridor . Officials at the time could not say whether extra construction was needed to take bikers , joggers and walkers across the streets , she said . Dig this : Fishers plans tunnel under 116th for Nickel Plate Trail In Carmel : Midtown is rising : 8 projects totaling $ 231M `` The cost still remains about $ 1 million per mile , separate from the special crossings , '' Elrod said . A website maintained by the two cities , Nickelplatetrail.com , said the construction estimate was `` assuming standard crossings at intersections . '' Because 11 crossings are needed in Fishers , the cost could shoot even higher if planners find that bridges or viaducts are needed at other intersections , officials acknowledged . Nickel Plate Trail in Fishers to be built in 3 segments Fishers ' 4.5-mile segment of the trail will be built in three stages . The first , from 106th Street to 126th Street , is likely to be the most expensive because of the crossing at 116th . The other sections are 96th to 106th and 126th to 146th . The trail will connect with the 4.5-mile section Noblesville plans , but that suburb wo n't start designing it for a couple of years . Down the line , observers say , a bridge or tunnel will probably be needed at busy 146th Street , a separated 4-lane road that borders the two cities . Train advocates have sued over trail Though Fishers is proceeding apace with the greenway , it still faces fierce opposition from train advocates , who object to tearing out the Nickel Plate railroad tracks to build it . They say the trail can be built alongside the tracks and have filed a series of unsuccessful lawsuits against the cities to halt construction . Logan Day , a member of Save the Nickel Plate , called the climbing cost estimate `` ludicrous '' and said it suggests the cities have not been upfront about the project . `` Our group saw this coming the minute they gave their original cost estimate , which we did n't think was realistic , '' Day said . `` But we had no idea the cost would go through the roof this fast . We feel this is a betrayal of the public trust . '' Save the Nickel Plate recently filed another suit in Hamilton Superior Court alleging that the cities and Hamilton County violated the state 's Open Door Act when they held a series of meetings to pass trail-related measures . The suit contends the public either was n't notified properly or was n't allowed to speak when the Fishers Board of Public Works and Safety , Noblesville Board of Public Works and Safety , and the county commissioners took certain actions . The group wants a judge to stop the trail from proceeding . Fishers Mayor Scott Fadness called the legal action `` frivolous '' and `` uninformed '' and is seeking to get the suit dismissed . He notes that Noblesville and Fishers each held public meetings attended by scores of residents after they announced the trail plan , as did the Hoosier Heritage Port Authority . Rail preservation activists and others also filed petitions of objection to the federal Surface Transportation Board when the cities sought permission to remove the tracks . The board approved the plan earlier this year , but more objections have since been filed and are still pending . Fishers mayor : Bridge/tunnel would cost about $ 2.5 M Fadness said at a budget presentation last week that a bridge or tunnel would cost about $ 2.5 million . Elrod said the $ 7 million to $ 9 million dedicated to the first segment of the trail in Fishers also includes the cost of amenities -- like bathrooms , water fountains , landscaping and art -- alongside the trail . Any dedicated dollars left over would be used to begin building one of the other trail sections , she said . A proposed property tax hike would help repay a $ 12 million bond that will fund the first leg of the trail and other road and public works projects , Fadness said . The tax increase amounts to 4 cents per $ 100 in assessed property values -- from 65 cents to 69 cents . Mike Colby , a member of the Fiscal Conservatives of Hamilton County , said he favored keeping the train tracks and opposes the trail because tax dollars could be better spent elsewhere . `` I think there are higher priorities , like repairing some of these private roads that the private land owners wo n't repair up to code , '' said Colby a former councilman . `` There are other areas of the city that need development attention . '' But Colby said he did n't see the cost of the trail ballooning to boondoggle levels . `` I think it will stay pretty close to what they said , '' said Colby . `` There are always cost overruns here and there due to unexpected things , like hidden utility lines . '' Carmel 's Monon Greenway saw similar cost escalation The added costs for the crossings is similar to what happened when Carmel built the 5.2-mile Monon Greenway , which was finished in 2001 and connects to the Monon Trail in Indianapolis . The Carmel trail 's cost was initially $ 1.6 million , with another $ 1.4 million for land acquisition . But since then the city has added a tunnel at 116th Street for $ 9 million and bridge over West Carmel Drive for $ 3 million . Now the city is spending $ 30 million to make the trail wider through Midtown and add parkland and other features . Carmel City Councilman Ron Carter , an avid bicyclist who was instrumental in planning the Monon in Carmel , said its economic benefits far outweigh the costs . Dozens of businesses have set up shop along the trail route , and home values have increased . Monon mural : Carmel to pay $ 42,000 for mural on Midtown parking garage Trail merger ? Monon , Nickel Plate trails could form 50-mile loop under proposal `` It 's a linear park , which is much cheaper to build than a box park , '' he said . `` You do n't need people to administer it or run programs . People know what to do on it . You run and walk and bike and shop . No one has to tell you how to do that . '' Carter said tunnels and bridges , though expensive , are necessary at busy intersections for safety and to keep trail traffic moving and users happy . `` It 's definitely worth the investment and something you have to do , '' he said . `` Especially because train tracks are in the middle of blocks . '' Two firms have nine months to finish the master plan for the Fishers trail . BBJ , a Seattle-based architectural firm , and Ex2 Partners of Indianapolis are being paid a combined $ 225,000 and will work together to design and promote the trail . The bid proposal the city sent out said the designers should plan a tunnel at 116th Street . The mayor 's office said a tunnel is still most likely , but a bridge has not been ruled out .

The Spanish forward , a loan signing from Paris Saint-Germain , finished crisply in the 47th minute to bring Arsene Wenger 's side down to earth after their opening 4-3 win over Leicester City . It was an early blow to Arsenal 's title aspirations and left them three points behind early pace-setters Manchester United , who won 4-0 for the second game running at Swansea City . Jese , 24 , only joined Stoke on Wednesday and he was quick to make an impression on the fans of his new team . After driving at Arsenal 's back four from halfway , he swapped passes with Saido Berahino and then drilled a left-foot shot past the advancing Petr Cech . Arsenal , who remain without the injured Alexis Sanchez , thought they had equalised in the 72nd minute when Alexandre Lacazette lashed home , but it was chalked off due to a marginal -- but correct -- offside . Stoke had not beaten Arsenal since December 2014 . Earlier , Romelu Lukaku had been on target again as Manchester United continued their fine form by crushing Swansea . Eric Bailly , Paul Pogba and substitute Anthony Martial also found the net at the Liberty Stadium , giving Jose Mourinho 's side their second big win after last weekend 's 4-0 victory over West Ham United . `` The team was confident from the first minute , '' said Mourinho after a result that means United have scored four goals in their first two league games for the first time in 110 years . `` I like to see the confidence that the players are having in this moment . There 's no panic . The team was always confident and always trying to move the ball . I 'm really happy . '' AUSTIN LATE SHOW Sadio Mane struck in the 73rd minute to earn Liverpool a 1-0 home win over Crystal Palace and get Jurgen Klopp 's side up and running after their 3-3 draw at Watford on the opening weekend . Beaten 3-0 at home by Huddersfield Town in their first game , Palace produced a much more solid display , but were undone with 17 minutes to play when Mane seized upon a loose ball to fire home . `` It was a hard job . I have no idea how much we had the ball , but it was a lot , '' Klopp told Sky Sports . `` We were really awake and defended really well and I loved the goal because it was not a clear situation . We had other chances , but I am completely happy with how we did the job today . '' Leicester , the 2016 champions , bounced back from defeat at Arsenal to beat Brighton and Hove Albion 2-0 at the King Power Stadium through Shinji Okazaki 's first-minute goal and a Harry Maguire header . Charlie Austin scored a 93rd-minute penalty to give Southampton a last-gasp 3-2 home win over West Ham . Goals from Manolo Gabbidini and Dusan Tadic , the latter a penalty , put Saints 2-0 up and West Ham new boy Marko Arnautovic was sent off in between for an elbow on Jack Stephens . Javier Hernandez 's first two West Ham goals drew the 10 men level , only for Austin to secure victory from the spot after Maya Yoshida was fouled by Pablo Zabaleta . Hal Robson-Kanu was hero and villain as West Bromwich Albion won 1-0 at Burnley . The Wales striker came off the bench to score a 71st-minute winner , but was then sent off for leading with his arm in a challenge on Matthew Lowton .

It 's looking more and more likely that the controversial ex-judge will win GOP senate race to replace Jeff Sessions Topics : Alabama , Donald Trump , GOP Civil War , Luther Strange , Mark Levin , Mitch McConnell , Roy Moore , Sarah Palin , Politics News , Elections News , News Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore testifies during his ethics trial before the Alabama Court of the Judiciary at the Alabama Judicial Building in Montgomery , Ala. , on Wednesday Sept. 28 , 2016 . He is accused of encouraging judges to defy the U.S. Supreme Court 's ruling legalizing gay marriage . ( Mickey Welsh/Montgomery Advertiser via AP , Pool ) ( Credit : AP ) Roy Moore 's brand of politics was in many ways a forerunner for President Donald Trump . Loud , opinionated , and without a care as to whom he may offend , the former state judge has been a political figure in Alabama for decades , famous for his desire to post a giant Ten Commandments diorama in his court room and his refusal to obey the Supreme Court 's ruling on same-sex marriage . It 's becoming increasingly clear that Moore 's Christian nationalist cultural populism is going to enable him to become the GOP 's choice in a special election to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions . With Republican voters primed by Trump to embrace a white Christian identity politics , Moore 's old-time blend of preaching and politicking looks like it has more power than the president 's endorsement of Moore 's rival , Luther Strange , the man who was appointed to fill the seat temporarily until the general election in November . Moore has led most polls throughout the race . In the Aug. 15 first round of the primary , he finished with 39 percent of the vote , 8 points higher than Strange . The race is headed into a second round of balloting Sept. 26 because Moore was unable to win more than 50 percent of the vote . During his election night party , Moore delivered an explicitly religious message . `` We need to go back to the recognition that God 's hand is still on this country and on this campaign , '' he said . `` We must be good again before we can be great . And we will never be good without God . '' The former judge has been twice removed from the bench by ethics courts for his refusal to obey higher court rulings . Trump appears to have endorsed Strange as a favor to the GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell , but with the president embroiled in a public war against Republican congressional leaders all bets are off as to what Trump may do next . On the first night of voting , the president took the unusual measure of congratulating both Moore and Strange , despite the fact that he had endorsed Strange . Congratulation to Roy Moore and Luther Strange for being the final two and heading into a September runoff in Alabama . Exciting race ! -- Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) August 16 , 2017 Hours afterward , presumably after receiving some panicked calls McConnell , Trump tweeted out what he should have said initially . Wow , Senator Luther Strange picked up a lot of additional support since my endorsement . Now in September runoff . Strong on Wall & Crime ! -- Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) August 16 , 2017 Moore has also been explicitly running against McConnell , arguing , as many conservative activists have claimed for many years , that the GOP leader suppresses far-right policy ideas . Despite McConnell 's consistent skill at foiling Democrats in the upper chamber , many conservative voters and activists believe him to be ineffective and cowardly . After Senate Republicans gave up on repealing the Affordable Care Act , Trump seems to have embraced this critique . For his part , Strange has been caught in the middle of the two men . In an advertisement , he tried to paint himself as one with Trump . `` Others attack our president , '' Strange said in the message . `` I 'm fighting with him to drain the swamp and repeal Obamacare . '' The winds may be shifting even further in Moore 's favor . On Thursday , former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin , still a favorite among Christian nationalists , announced that she was endorsing Moore . She joins several hardcore conservative groups who are seeking to defeat Strange as a blow to McConnell . On Tuesday , far-right radio host Mark Levin told his audience called McConnell a `` mob boss '' who deserved to be brought to his knees . `` Mitch McConnell may think he 's a mob boss , but we do n't have mob bosses in the United States Senate , in the greatest Republic on the face of the earth , '' Levin said . `` It 's time that we make this mob boss heel ! It 's time that we bring him to his knee , like Kaepernick ! '' Friday afternoon , the Washington Post reported that Trump is now considering pulling back from the race , not rescinding his endorsement of Strange but becoming less of an active participant than he had been in the first round of the primary when he had recorded a voice message that was sent to Alabama voters via telephone on Strange 's behalf . During his own campaign , Trump was generally uninterested in appealing to conservatives , even saying several times that he did not consider himself one but since taking office , he has strongly tried to adhere to the concerns of base Republican voters . With Palin going her own way and Moore continuing to hold the lead , there 's a strong indication that Trump may decide to cut back so as to distance himself in the event that Strange loses the race .

Adjusted net income of $ 0.07 per diluted share , for third quarter 2014 compared to adjusted net income of $ 0.06 per diluted share , in third quarter 2013 . Nine Months Adjusted EBITDA , pro forma for divestitures and net of Noncontrolling Interest , was $ 596 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to $ 418 million in the first nine months of 2013 , 42 % year-over-year growth . $ 509 million for first nine months of 2014 compared to $ 569 million in first nine months of 2013 . Included in the first nine months of 2014 results is $ 70 million of cash paid to unwind hedges related to the Adjusted net income of $ 109.2 million , or $ 0.19 per diluted share , for first nine months of 2014 compared to adjusted net income of $ 0.11 per diluted share , in first nine months of 2013 . Adjusted net income available to common stockholders , pro forma adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures . Each measure is defined and reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure under `` Non-GAAP Financial Measures '' beginning on page 7 . As previously discussed in a Form 8-K filed on November 4 , 2014 , the Company has been in discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding certain accounting matters . As a result of these discussions , the Company restated its 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30 , 2014 . For the three month periods ended , March 31 , 2013 and 2014 and June 30 , 2013 and 2014 , an estimated CO 2 under delivery shortfall penalty was recorded in each quarter . The effect of the restatement for 2013 is to transfer a portion of the annual CO 2 under delivery shortfall penalty accrual that was previously recorded at year-end to the quarter-end periods within such year . The change in accounting treatment impacts the first , second and third quarters of 2013 by approximately $ 8 million of net income per quarter , while rendering no change to the 2013 annual net income . The first and second quarters of 2014 are also impacted by approximately $ 8 million of net income per quarter . Additionally , the Company also revised the recording of the Century Plant construction contract to account for it under the full cost method of accounting rather than the completed contract method of accounting for the year ended 2012 . This resulted in eliminating an equal amount of income and expense from the 2012 Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and had no impact on total assets , total liabilities , net income or retained earnings . These restatements along with our Form 10-Q for the three month period ended September 30 , 2014 , which also included restated financial information related to the delivery shortfall penalty accrued for the three month period ended September 30 , 2013 , were filed on January 8 , 2015 . James Bennett , SandRidge 's Chief Executive Officer and President , stated , `` As highlighted in our November third quarter operations update , we 're expanding our low cost multilateral program and successfully extending our Mid-Continent resource base with Woodford production . Since the operating update , oil prices have fallen sharply ; however , SandRidge is defensively positioned for 2015 . We have an enviable hedge position on the vast majority of our liquids production , have no bond maturities until 2020 and at quarter end $ 1.4 billion of liquidity . Importantly , our Mid-Continent drilling program continues to generate commercial returns , even at current commodity prices . Given the market backdrop , we are high grading our development plans and are already reducing our rig count and capex levels . We anticipate announcing 2015 capital plans and full year guidance in February . Meanwhile , our teams are focused on continued well cost reductions , now further supported by likely lower service costs ahead . '' Operational and Financial Statistics Excludes production attributable to Permian properties ( sold first quarter 2013 ) and Gulf of Mexico properties ( sold first quarter 2014 ) . Expense for three and nine-month periods ended September 30 , 2013 has been restated for quarterly accrual of CO Excludes transaction costs , legal settlements , severance and consent solicitation costs totaling $ 0.1 million and $ 7.5 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30 , 2014 , respectively . Excludes transaction costs , legal settlements , severance , annual incentive plan adoption effect and consent solicitation costs totaling $ 2.7 million and $ 102.2 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30 , 2013 , respectively . Excludes $ 0.2 million and $ 2.2 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30 , 2014 , respectively , and $ 1.7 million and $ 54.7 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30 , 2013 , respectively , for the acceleration of stock awards . Includes accretion of asset retirement obligation . Includes shares considered antidilutive for calculating earnings per share in accordance with GAAP for certain periods presented . The table below sets forth the Company 's consolidated oil and natural gas price swaps and collars for the years 2015 and 2016 as of The Company 's capital structure at September 30 , 2014 During the third quarter of 2014 , the Company 's debt , net of cash balances , increased by approximately $ 330 million as a result of funding the Company 's drilling program . The Company had no amount drawn under its senior credit facility . Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted operating cash flow , adjusted EBITDA , pro forma adjusted EBITDA , adjusted net income and adjusted net income attributable to noncontrolling interest are non-GAAP financial measures . The Company defines adjusted operating cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities and adjusted for cash ( paid ) received on financing derivatives . It defines EBITDA as net income ( loss ) before income tax ( benefit ) expense , interest expense and depreciation , depletion and amortization and accretion of asset retirement obligations . Adjusted EBITDA , as presented herein , is EBITDA excluding asset impairment , interest income , ( gain ) loss on derivative contracts net of cash received ( paid ) on settlement of derivative contracts , ( gain ) loss on sale of assets , transaction costs , legal settlements , consent solicitation costs , severance , loss on extinguishment of debt and other various non-cash items ( including non-cash portion of noncontrolling interest and stock-based compensation ) . Pro forma adjusted EBITDA , as presented herein , is adjusted EBITDA excluding adjusted EBITDA attributable to properties or subsidiaries sold during the period . Adjusted operating cash flow and adjusted EBITDA are supplemental financial measures used by the Company 's management and by securities analysts , investors , lenders , rating agencies and others who follow the industry as an indicator of the Company 's ability to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service or incur additional debt . The Company also uses these measures because adjusted operating cash flow and adjusted EBITDA relate to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements that the Company may not control and may not relate to the period in which the operating activities occurred . Further , adjusted operating cash flow and adjusted EBITDA allow the Company to compare its operating performance and return on capital with those of other companies without regard to financing methods and capital structure . These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash provided by operating activities prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( `` GAAP '' ) . Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute for net income , operating income , cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP . Adjusted EBITDA excludes some , but not all , items that affect net income and operating income and these measures may vary among other companies . Therefore , the Company 's adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies . Management also uses the supplemental financial measure of adjusted net income , which excludes tax ( benefit ) expense adjustment , asset impairment , ( gain ) loss on derivative contracts net of cash received ( paid ) on settlement of derivative contracts , ( gain ) loss on sale of assets , transaction costs , legal settlements , consent solicitation costs , loss on extinguishment of debt , severance and other non-cash items from income available ( loss applicable ) to common stockholders . Management uses this financial measure as an indicator of the Company 's operational trends and performance relative to other oil and natural gas companies and believes it is more comparable to earnings estimates provided by securities analysts . Adjusted net income is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for loss applicable to common stockholders . The supplemental measure of adjusted net income attributable to noncontrolling interest is used by the Company 's management to measure the impact on the Company 's financial results of the ownership by third parties of interests in the Company 's less than wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries . Adjusted net income attributable to noncontrolling interest excludes the portion of asset impairment , ( gain ) loss on derivative contracts net of cash ( paid ) received on settlement of derivative contracts , legal settlement and loss on sale of assets attributable to third-party ownership in less than wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries from net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest . Adjusted net income attributable to noncontrolling interest is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered a substitute for net income attributable to noncontrolling interest . The tables below reconcile the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to operating cash flow , EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA , adjusted net income available to common stockholders and adjusted net income attributable to noncontrolling interest . Excludes unrealized gains on interest rate swaps of $ 2.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30 , 2013 . Excludes amounts paid upon early settlement of derivative contracts . Includes loss on the Permian divestiture of approximately $ 398.9 million for the nine-month period ended September 30 , 2013 .

Kaka was one of Real 's most expensive signings in 2009 when the club paid Milan 65 million euros for him after a highly-succesful six-season spell with the Rossoneri . After being left on the sidelines under Jose Mourinho , Kaka 's chances of more regular first team action at the Santiago Bernabeu faded further when his former coach at Milan , Carlo Ancelotti , took over the ` Galacticos ' for the new season . With Brazil hosting the 2014 World Cup , Kaka launched a plea to leave Real and the Spaniards allowed the 31-year-old to return to his former club on a free transfer . Kaka was met by dozens of fans upon his arrival at Milan-Linate airport on Monday , a scene that was repeated when he met club vice-president Adriano Galliani late on Monday . At the Giannino restaurant , a favourite haunt of AC Milan and its players , were dozens of fans noisily convened to celebrate Kaka 's arrival . The player sipped Champagne and was presented with a cake adorned with the words ` Some love affairs never end ' . Kaka , who has signed a two-year contract , was delighted to be back . `` I really wanted to come here and now I 'm back I am so happy . I 've returned home ! '' said the Brazilian , who took a significant pay cut to facilitate his move to the San Siro . Kaka 's first spell at the Rossoneri , from 2003 to 2009 , coincided with his rise to prominence that culminated in him winning the 2007 Ballon d'Or after leading Milan to the Champions League title that year . Coach Massimiliano Allegri on Friday said : `` He 's versatile , and his technical attributes would be a big plus to the team . '' Although brought in as a replacement for playmaker Kevin-Prince Boateng , who was sold to Schalke 04 last week , it remains to be seen how Allegri slots Kaka into his system . Kaka began his previous spell at Milan playing just behind striker Andriy Shevchenko , but went on to occupy the main striker 's role as well as variously changing position in Ancelotti 's preferred 4-3-1-2 system . Mario Balotelli in the central striker 's role flanked by , for example , Robinho and Stephan El Shaarawy . Asked if he had already spoken tactics with Allegri , Kaka replied : `` It 's been such a frenetic few days that we have n't had time to talk about anything .

The Aussie F1 star faced the press yesterday for the first time since dropping the bombshell he would be joining Renault in 2019 , telling reporters he was `` ready for a new challenge '' . `` I never said I was unloved . It was more just the routine , going to the same factory year after year . I felt it made my enjoyment for the sport a bit numb at times , '' Ricciardo said .

T&C s apply . SIGN UP NOW > TV GUIDE : Watch the Formula 1 Belgian GP LIVE on FOX SPORTS Nearly everyone in the F1 world expected Ricciardo to re-sign with Red Bull , who he has raced with since 2014 . He hinted multiple times he was going to commit - albeit not specifically saying it would be with the energy drink team - but during the summer break took everyone by surprise when he announced his future was taking a twist . Ricciardo 's engine trouble 1:18 Red Bull boss Christian Horner was completely blindsided , saying he thought it was a joke . At practice for this weekend 's Belgian Grand Prix , Horner said he was expecting Ricciardo to remain because the 29-year-old had gone as far as to record a video message with Red Bull to announce he was staying put , but his final decision to leave meant the paperwork was never signed . `` By the time we got to the Austrian Grand Prix , the whole lot looked pretty much there , '' Horner told Sky Sports in Belgium . `` There was an agreement in principal . It was about sorting out the paperwork . Over Hockenheim and Hungary that happened . `` I thought it was a joke for the summer holiday . I was expecting the paperwork to be signed . `` He 'd even recorded the message announcing his renewal . `` But the third time he told me I realised it was for real and you just have to wish him well . '' Horner was shocked by Ricciardo 's switch . Source : Getty Images Ricciardo has come under fire from Red Bull adviser Helmut Marko , who accused the West Australian of misleading Red Bull over his contract decision . While Ricciardo did n't directly address those claims , he admitted he did have one regret when it came to telling his bosses he was going to leave . `` I was in the States . If I 'm really honest it would have been something I would have liked to do in person and face-to-face , '' Ricciardo said in Belgium . `` Let 's say , a bit more like an adult , a man about it . `` But it was the best I could do so I called Christian ( Horner ) . I did n't want to get into too much small talk , I just wanted to try and get it done . `` It was obviously a bit of a shock and surprise to him but we talked it out over a few minutes and by the end he was understanding and respected my decision . `` It all ended very amicably and basically they 're sorry to see me go and appreciate what I 've done and given to the team . '' Read : Jilted Red Bull takes aim at Ricciardo RENAULT : RICCIARDO DID N'T BUY RED BULL ` JOKE ' Red Bull just is n't as quick as the top dogs . Source : Getty Images One of Red Bull 's biggest failings in recent times , and the main reason it 's been unable to compete with Ferrari and Mercedes for a constructors ' championship , has been its lack of engine power . Its power units , supplied by Renault , are n't on the same level with what the Silver Arrows and Scuderia have in their cars and it 's cost Ricciardo and teammate Max Verstappen race wins . It 's why Horner and Co. made the decision to ditch Renault and partner with new engine provider Honda in 2019 -- a move they would have been hoping was enough to convince Ricciardo to stay . Honda already powers Red Bull 's junior team Toro Rosso but for all the optimism within the Red Bull garage about the change-up -- Marko said `` nobody can keep up '' with Honda -- Renault boss Cyril Abiteboul said Ricciardo was n't buying into the `` unimpressive '' hype and accused Red Bull of trying to undermine Renault .

I think Honda is progressing , but all the communication of Toro Rosso regarding Honda , when Honda has already introduced 11 or 12 power units . `` Frankly it 's a joke , and unimpressive . That they can influence a guy like ( Riciardo 's replacement at Red Bull in 2019 ) Pierre Gasly I can understand , and not a driver like Daniel Ricciardo , and that I respect . '' Without divulging the intimate details of their negotiations , Abiteboul said Renault convinced Ricciardo to come across even though it was n't the highest bidder . `` Renault can afford pretty much anything , '' Abiteboul said . `` Renault is the largest car maker involved in Formula 1 , full stop . So we can afford anything as long as it makes sense . `` Then it 's just a question of value for money and whether it makes sense to spend that given where we are in the development of our team . Second , I do n't think we were the highest bidder in obtaining Daniel , without going into details . `` He bought into the project not necessarily because of the money . I do n't think it would be great to put this sort of light on Daniel . '' RICCIARDO 'S CANDID CONFESSION There will be no more shoeys in Red Bull colours next year . Source : Getty Images It was n't just quitting Red Bull that gave Ricciardo sleepless nights -- the entire sport was taking its toll . He said he 's felt `` exhausted '' at times this season and could relate to 2016 world champion Nico Rosberg , who shocked everyone by retiring after winning the title . `` There 's been times this year that I 've felt exhausted , maybe a bit jaded , and for the first time in my career , not completely enjoying F1 , '' Ricciardo told Fairfax Media . `` There 's been times when I 've thought , ` This is why Rosberg retired , ' and he had it a lot more intense than me . Or why Casey Stoner retired from MotoGP very young . `` I can see how you could feel burnt out or a bit over it . '' Ricciardo said there were `` several options '' he could have pursued . He had talks with McLaren but Renault 's honesty won him over . The French outfit was upfront with him from the beginning , telling him the team was not going to be as quick as Red Bull in 2019 . Ricciardo has been strong in saying his only goal is to win a world title , and he 's in the prime of his career now , so you 'd think an admission of inferiority would turn him off making the switch . But the more he thought about it and the more Renault explained its plans for 2020 and beyond , the more excited Ricciardo became about jolting himself out of a rut and he had `` the balls '' to take a punt . `` They have a winning mentality and a realistic way of going about it , which I liked , '' Ricciardo said .", "date": "2018-08-25 00:12:00", "url": "https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/formula-one/more-details-of-daniel-ricciardos-agonising-decision-emerge/news-story/f735da447a530275e1ad46fbefc71642", "phase": "E", "title": "Daniel Ricciardo Renault F1 contract : More Red Bull shocks emerge James Matthey", "names": [{"name": "daniel ricciardo", "ids": ["Q82816"], "offsets": [[4, 6], [103, 104], [171, 172], [228, 229], [265, 266], [415, 416], [423, 424], [450, 451], [507, 508], [638, 639], [641, 642], [734, 735], [775, 776], [819, 820], [868, 869], [885, 886], [1022, 1024], [1044, 1045], [1139, 1140], [1174, 1175], [1177, 1178], [1207, 1208], [1284, 1285], [1345, 1346], [1399, 1400], [1464, 1465], [1505, 1506]]}, {"name": "johnnie walker", "ids": ["Q466525", "Q6266126", "Q939019"], "offsets": [[126, 128]]}, {"name": "christian horner", "ids": ["Q173472"], "offsets": [[236, 238], [260, 261], [325, 326], [411, 412], [541, 542], [543, 544], [745, 746]]}, {"name": "helmut marko", "ids": ["Q78545"], "offsets": [[432, 434], [803, 804]]}, {"name": "max verstappen", "ids": ["Q2239218", "Q2744186"], "offsets": [[737, 739]]}, {"name": "cyril abiteboul", "ids": ["Q4054762"], "offsets": [[816, 818], [910, 911], [1040, 1041], [1066, 1067]]}, {"name": "pierre gasly", "ids": ["Q11816647"], "offsets": [[1011, 1013]]}, {"name": "nico rosberg", "ids": ["Q75820"], "offsets": [[1238, 1240], [1303, 1304]]}, {"name": "casey stoner", "ids": ["Q313563"], "offsets": [[1320, 1322]]}]}, {"articleID": "2018090412_00290178_W", "content": "Posted by Richard Barry , Associate Editor - Politics and the Arts on Jul 21 , 2015 in 2016 Presidential Election , Featured , Politics | 0 comments What former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford can teach us about Donald Trump Since the only thing going on in domestic politics over the last few days is the Donald Trump story , I 'll bite . I 'll try to say something useful about it . Here goes : I am American living in Toronto . I have lived here for decades , and worked in politics for much of that time , including a stint at Toronto City Hall as a political staffer . That means I got to witness , up close and personal , the phenomenon much of the world came to know as Mayor Rob Ford , a.k.a. the crack-smoking mayor of Toronto . I could go into detail about how someone so unqualified came to be mayor of one of the truly great cities of the world . Partly it had to do with the weaknesses of other candidates , partly vote splitting , partly the tension between voters outside the downtown core and those within it , but mostly it had to do with the fact that , for a brief moment when it counted , Rob Ford was very popular . Though he was from a relatively wealthy family and very much aligned with conservative politics in Canada , his popularity cut across ideological lines . Yes , people open to a conservative message supported him , but many not necessarily in that orbit were drawn in . Less affluent voters , supposedly less sophisticated voters and others typically considered to be without power liked Ford 's very unsophisticated and direct way of saying things . They related to the fact that he spoke the way they did and broke things down in a way that made sense to them , even if there was a great of deal of dishonesty in the simplification . If the pointy heads talked about complex transit policy , he talked about how dirty the subways were and about how streetcars and bike lanes made it difficult for cars to get around downtown . He called it the war on the car . If other candidates talked about city budget woes , he talked about how city councillors got free coffee and sandwiches at council meetings . He promised to shrink the size of government by reducing taxes and eliminating fees , putting cash in people 's pockets . And he certainly was n't afraid to criticize those in greatest need while making it sound to the poorer sorts like he was talking about someone else . The more the media and other opinion leaders criticized Ford 's coarseness and apparent failings as a potential political leader , the more his supporters rallied around him . And that coarseness was legendary . Going into the election his history of gaffes and indiscretions was well known . He had a drunk driving conviction in Florida in 1999 ; he referred to Asian people in a 2008 speech as `` Orientals who work like dogs ... [ who are ] slowly taking over '' ; he called a fellow councillor a `` waste of skin '' ; he had been forcibly removed from a Maple Leafs hockey game for verbally abusing a spectator ; he expressed opposition to homeless shelters and immigration ; and even once said that cyclists killed by cars have only themselves to blame . Torontonians elected him anyway . It just did n't matter . The plain talk about how the city should be run , boiling down complex public policy to the level of manageable annoyances , along with the , I suppose , very human way of expressing himself and living his life resonated with voters . Of course , his problems ran deep and his mayoralty eventually imploded , but it took a while and horrible international media attention for the final curtain to fall . Even then , when he was forced to end his campaign because of health issues , his brother Doug Ford , in many ways his mirror image , stepped in and actually received 34 % of the vote on election day to the winners 40 % . So , after all that , the family brand remained resilient . I am not suggesting this means Donald Trump can win the Republican nomination , and certainly not the presidency ( though Ford 's victory in 2010 was unthinkable to many until the votes were counted and certified ) . A mayoralty race is a very different beast , but there are lessons to be learned . There may be much dishonesty in presenting complex political issues as if they are nothing more than technical problems that can be solved by the right leader , perhaps someone who has succeeded in business . Such a person , with the will to forge ahead , unconcerned about the niceties that apparently hamstring the less capable , could to some be a very compelling candidate . Yes , the McCain comment was off-script and may do Trump 's campaign harm , but we are living through a time in politics when , and I 'll use the word again , a certain coarseness is not only forgiven but embraced by a large part of the electorate . Candidates who claim to be able to easily explain and solve our most complex problems are treated as saviours , which in itself is not new . What is new is that the boorish behaviour exhibited by some of these `` saviours '' is perceived as proof that they are tough enough , and unconcerned enough about conventional or polite methods , to get the job done . The mantra has become `` simplify and bluster .

The comment followed the U.S. State Department 's publication of the `` 2017 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices . '' Still , relative to last year , when North Korean state media called Trump a `` war maniac '' and the U.S. `` a kingdom of crime , '' the vitriol from Korean Central Television has declined ahead of what would be a historic meeting between the leaders of both nations . `` Compared to words like ` war maniac ' and ` American invader , ' North Korea seems to have eased their message of warning ahead of the summit , '' Kang Dong-wan , a professor at South Korea 's Dong-A University who is an expert on North Korean culture , told ABC News . `` Their nation has considered the U.S. as the main enemy for years , so the recently alleviated descriptions are a positive sign . '' KCTV over the last few years has praised the country 's own unbelievable productivity while depicting accidents and suffering in foreign lands . Last week , there was a report criticizing the U.S. for a shooting in Dallas and another about China 's criticisms of the U.S. for alleging China ignored World Trade Organization rules . Rodung Sinmun , North Korea 's state newspaper , last week published articles on the late-19th-century Cuban War of Independence and the ongoing travesty in Syria . `` Imperialists , including the United States , attach collateral conditions for aid , and that leads to become a means of control over the country and interference in domestic affairs , '' one report read . Beginning with Kim Jong Un 's New Year 's address , however , which signaled a desire for peace on the peninsula , KCTV has curtailed hostile remarks about the U.S. -- and South Korea . Reports including political meetings in the capital and South Korean K-Pop singers traveling to Pyongyang have become more common . KCTV aired video Thursday of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo 's visit this week to North Korea , portraying it in a positive light and saying Kim expressed `` much satisfaction '' with the results of the meeting . The anchor noted that Kim welcomed Pompeo with `` immense enthusiasm '' and `` sincerely congratulated '' him on recently becoming secretary . KCTV has also shown a lot of footage of the recent summit between North Korea and South Korea , viewed as a tremendous success and essential groundwork for the upcoming U.S.-North Korea meeting . Ri Chun Hee , the iconic North Korean News anchor , discussed every detail of that meeting in a moving voiceover . Following the 12-hour meeting between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in , Korean Central News Agency wrote an editorial saying that the U.S. `` must show corresponding sincerity at the right timing . '' That same report said worldwide public sentiment was to end sanctions , ultimately benefiting North Korea . How state media choose to cover the Kim-Trump summit , and what results from it , remains to be seen . ABC News ' Jaesang Lee and Jiweon Park contributed to this report .

The former Old Market House in Hamilton Street , Birkenhead , will be renamed Marriss House after Professor Dorothy Marriss , who was the first Dean of the university 's Faculty of Health and Social Care and former Deputy Vice-Chancellor . The purchase represents a multi-million pound investment by the university . The building will contain a fully-equipped skills laboratory , made to resemble a state-of-the-art hospital ward . This will include virtual reality equipment and offer the space and technology to allow student nurses to practice clinical skills before partaking in work experience at hospitals and in the community . It will also contain classrooms of various sizes , smaller rooms for group work and a fully-stocked library . Students on the Bachelor of Nursing programme , currently based on the university 's premises at the Clatterbridge Hospital site , will transfer to the new building , along with academic and professional services staff , with teaching planned to start for the next academic year in September 2018 . The new site will also house a range of postgraduate healthcare students on programmes such as MSc Art Therapy ; Non-Medical Prescribing and a range of other courses . University chiefs say the new facility will ensure the Faculty of Health and Social Care is in a strong position to respond to proposed changes to nursing education in the future . Professor Angela Simpson , Executive Dean of the Faculty of Health and Social Care , said : `` The new site at Marriss House , Birkenhead , offers prospective student nurses an exciting opportunity to learn within a locally based university site that provides an excellent learning environment including a library and clinical simulation facility . `` Our nursing programmes are carefully designed and delivered in partnership with a range of NHS , private and voluntary sector organisations across the region . University of Chester students are highly regarded by local employers on completion of their studies . `` Last year 99 per cent of students completing the Bachelor of Nursing ( BN ) Honours programme in adult field of practice were in employment within six months of completing the programme . '' Government plans emphasise the need for more care to be delivered at home , and less in hospitals , with greater focus on public health and health education . Other programmes could also relocate to Marriss House if they are able to benefit from the geographical location and new facilities . Professor Tim Wheeler , Vice-Chancellor of the University of Chester , said : `` The university is dedicated to educating the very best nurses of the future and the facilities at this new site , Marriss House , will enable us to fulfil this commitment . `` We forward to working closely with Wirral Metropolitan College to provide a seamless opportunity for students to progress from health and social care programmes into nursing and allied health professions . `` It is also an honour to recognise Professor Dorothy Marriss in this way , as she played such a significant role in developing the faculty .

You 're not ... hiding anything from me ... are you ... ? '' Katherine McBride ( \u30ad\u30e3\u30b5\u30ea\u30f3 \u30fb \u30de\u30af\u30d6\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9 Kyasarin Makuburaido ) is Vincent Brooks 's loyal and steadfast girlfriend , who wants something more . She and Vincent were classmates in high school , but they only started dating after they met again at their high school reunion five years ago and have currently been together since . Katherine has been thinking more and more about their relationship , and wants him to fully commit to her by marriage , but his indecisiveness is starting to increasingly annoy her as time goes by . Katherine currently works as an office manager for a clothing company called Bantam Suits , the same company Todd Bozeman and Archie Wallace work for . Katherine and Vincent do n't live together for unknown reasons ( possibly because of their workplace commutes ) although she occasionally visits him to see how he 's doing and drop off snacks . During the game , they frequently visit a cafe called Chrono Rabbit where they meet up to see how each other are doing and chow down on food . Asides from the main Golden Playhouse storyline , Katherine is also a playable character in co-op mode , where she and Vincent must work together to ascend the Babel . If a second player is present , they will control Katherine . If not , Katherine will be controlled by an AI bot . Contents [ show ] Design Edit Katherine has long blonde-beige hair , brown eyes , and glasses . She wears blue nail polish and violet eyeshadow . She wears a black turtleneck sweater with vertical blue lines on the lower half ; the sweater is rolled up to show a bit of her forearms . She black pants , a blue jeweled accessory around her waist , and black high heels . Personality Edit `` No ... I usually do the killing in my dreams . '' -- Katherine to Vincent 's question if she has died in a dream Katherine has a by-the-book Type A personality . She is intelligent , mature , assertive , dominant , responsible , goal-oriented , but is not without a sense of humor . Katherine is a bit of a workaholic who puts her career above almost everything else . When Vincent admits to working severe overtime with no extra pay , she chides him for being taken advantage of it and not taking a stand for himself . She never tells him to relax when it comes to work and accepts work as a valid excuse if he misses time with her . Katherine ordering Vincent to be neater . At times , Katherine can seem overbearing , naggy and bossy with a domineering attitude towards Vincent . For example , she is trying to pressure him into marriage which he is n't comfortable with . She proves that if someone ca n't be trusted to do something right , she will take care of it for them . The clearest example of this is when she takes full control of their finances after Vincent consistently spends all his money on new computers , cell phones , alcohol and cigarettes . Another example is that she hates Vincent 's messy apartment room , and one of her texts reveals she has a set of spare keys to Vincent 's apartment and she cleaned it for him at least once ( Vincent may condone this or reply `` Do n't touch my stuff . '' ) Katherine is not shown to be the affectionate type . The only time she kisses Vincent or tells him she loves him is during the Katherine True Ending . Most times she leaves him with a simple `` Goodbye '' . Whether this is a result of their recent relationship troubles or because of her natural personality is unknown . It 's unknown how she feels about Vincent 's drinking and smoking habits although she once sent a text saying Vincent should n't drink too much which shows that she cares about Vincent 's health , and because of this , she probably does n't like the idea of Vincent smoking . This is affirmed by her smug smiling when she says that Vincent should stop smoking since it wo n't be good for the child . From this , it can be deduced that Katherine loves and cares for Vincent in her own way . Katherine is always straight-forward , and does n't appreciate between-the-lines insinuations or passive-aggressive accusations , both of which Vincent is guilty of . She frequently texts Vincent to let him know what 's new as well as her feelings . Despite her cautious and responsible personality , Katherine apparently overlooks unprotected sex with Vincent , eventually thinking she may be pregnant . However , this is likely intentional by Katherine , hinting that she wants to become pregnant so that when she has a child , Vincent wo n't leave her and commit to marriage . Even though her fidelity was called into question with Steve Delhomme , she has only made one lie ( of omission ) in the entire game : not telling Vincent immediately when she knew she was n't pregnant . While clues have been left that Katherine might have been lying about the pregnancy as a test for Vincent to pass , her reaction during the break up with him paints a clearer picture . She not only tells him that the knowledge of the pregnancy actually scared her , but admits to him she knew about the news earlier , but did n't tell him because she feared he would leave her . She feels guilty about this and realizes she was not being honest with Vincent , and how she was being manipulative by trying to `` trap '' Vincent with a child . Her moral conscience arises when she decides to tell Vincent this truth . Katherine Meets Catherine Katherine meets Catherine . The only things in the game shown to rattle her are when she murders Catherine ( though it happens in a dream ) , and when she is effectively dealing with the possibility of being pregnant completely alone , as Vincent is off in his own world . It can also be inferred that Katherine enjoys fashion , given she puts the effort into painting her nails and wears eyeshadow . She works at a clothing company and seems to go on a shopping spree in one of the endings although it could be argued her working at a clothing company does n't necessarily means she likes clothing , and that the boxes in her ending may not be clothes either . In an interview , her voice actress ( Michelle Ruff ) said Katherine is also very vulnerable , yet strong and courageous , saying she stands up for herself and what she believes is best for her . `` She 's the character we find ourselves relating to from real life experiences or wanting to relate to . I really relied on my own experiences to put myself in her shoes . I think you 'll find when you listen to her , she 's really close to my own natural voice . I really tried to be as vulnerable as I could in that booth when we were recording . '' [ 1 ] Voice director , Valerie Arem , commented , `` Katherine is a real woman . She has dreams and emotions and feelings that make her special and unique . She really wants Vincent to see her for that and love her for her uniqueness . She is the strong one in their relationship and I think she is really hoping that Vincent will step up and finally be the strong one . '' [ 2 ] History Edit Katherine attended elementary school with Vincent , Orlando Haddick , Jonny Ariga and Erica Anderson . Katherine 's and Vincent 's friendship was initially antagonistic , as the boys would often steal and eat her lunch . Though it upset her , she began giving Vincent her snacks , indicating that she had a crush on him . They met again during their 10-year high school reunion . Afterwards when she was depressed , Vincent ran to her side in the middle of the night and comforted her . He found out that she was having dating problems and started to give her advice , but ended up falling for her himself . While seemingly romantic , Erica theorizes that Katherine only started dating him because her maternal instincts and dominant personality would n't allow her to leave a slacker like Vincent alone . The two have been in a steady relationship for the past 5 years , though Vincent is n't interested in taking it to the next level , and Katherine 's parents have started to pressure her to marry . Many of Katherine 's friends are also married and have kids , and it makes her feel left out to the point where Katherine wants both marriage and a child/children . It is ambiguous if this is what Katherine truly wants , or if she is vulnerable to peer pressure . Catherine Edit Katherine 's first scenes in the game are with Vincent , arguing over his lack of overtime pay and inability to stand up for himself . Katherine introduces the possibility of marriage between them . Though he blows her off , she continues bringing it up in texts and conversations until she finally tells him that she thinks she 's pregnant and will probably have to take maternity leave . Although initially upset by his sheer terror , he manages to calm her down . Katherine 's pregnancy Katherine almost discovers Catherine . In the following days , she visits him at home to bring him cake ( which results in an ant infestation ) , and meets him at Chrono Rabbit , all the time narrowly missing Catherine . She finds out she actually is pregnant , which she tells Vincent , who reacts much the same as he did before . During one of their meetings , Vincent passive-aggressively accuses her of cheating on him with a man named Steve Delhomme , whom she never heard of before . At this point , Katherine mentions the mysterious and intimidating anonymous texts she 's been receiving . These turn out to be from Catherine , sent in an effort to drive a wedge further between her and Vincent . Katherine furious at Vincent for cheating . Later on , she manifests with Catherine in Vincent 's dream on Day 8 , which takes place in his apartment . After a heated exchange of insults between the two women in which they call each other bitches and whores and futile attempts of trying to order each other out of Vincent 's room , Katherine , due to Vincent 's betrayal and Catherine 's constant insults of her worthlessness to Vincent and Catherine 's superiority to Katherine , snaps with despair . On the edge of her sanity and feeling embarrassed , humiliated and defeated , Katherine silently stands up and moves over the kitchen sink to search for a kitchen knife while still facing and blankly staring at Vincent and Catherine but to no avail as Catherine predicted this and took the knife in advance . Katherine horrified by Catherine 's death . Vincent attempts to calm down Katherine by telling her that he had already called off his affair with Catherine , causing Catherine to snap with rage and jealousy and Catherine blames Katherine for Vincent 's confusion . Catherine claims that if Katherine went away , Vincent could finally be free and attempts to kill Katherine with the kitchen knife . Vincent tries to defend Katherine and is cut non-fatally in his right lower rib cage . As Katherine dashes over the coffee table to escape , Catherine grabs Katherine 's hair , shoves her to the floor and a struggle begins . Catherine ends up impaling her abdomen while seemingly having the upper-hand on Katherine while they are both on the ground . Catherine ~ Stage 8-1 ( Normal Gold EN Version ) Catherine 's boss form . Vincent pulls a terrified Katherine away to escape only to find that the two have been pulled into the Nightmare World : 8-1 , The Cathedral . They both climb the tower , with a transformed Catherine chasing after them . Katherine , understandably , lags behind due to not having any experience climbing blocks in the nightmares . At the top of the tower , Vincent confesses his love and commitment to Katherine when she can not continue on because of his previous lies and affairs . Katherine cries and turns suicidal , apologizing to Vincent and saying she ca n't think of the future any more . Katherine asks Vincent if he still thought about her during the affair , and Vincent says of course he did . After Vincent apologizes to her , she is still reluctant to escape . The area shakes and Katherine falls down , but Vincent jumps to cushion Katherine . Katherine asks Vincent a question , but does n't finish it . Catherine ` Part 13 ' Cutscenes Only Katherine breaks up with Vincent . In reality on Day 8 , when Vincent wakes up from his nightmare , he finds Katherine in his apartment , who has no recollection of the prior events , even mentioning she has been watching him toss and turn in his sleep for a while . She came by because he was n't answering his phone . When Vincent mentions Catherine , Katherine confronts Vincent on the infidelity she knows he has been hiding from her , and he admits he was cheating on a girl with the same name as her , but he ended it and is done with her . Katherine admits that her pregnancy was a false alarm , although she was incredibly scared because Vincent 's reactions did not increase her confidence in him , making her question if Vincent would rather leave her and the baby , and not have to deal with the stress and commitment of being a father . Katherine also admits she discovered she knew she was not pregnant earlier , but did not tell him because she felt that he would leave her . Although Vincent claims he was happy about the news of her `` pregnancy '' , Katherine is saddened because she is not entirely convinced . Despite his best efforts to stop her , she politely and firmly breaks up with him and leaves his apartment , giving him an energy drink on the way out , likely because of his fatigue . Katherine only shows up in her three endings : Katherine True Ending , Katherine Good Ending and Katherine Bad Ending . Katherine and Vincent kiss in Katherine True . Katherine True : Vincent tricks Katherine into meeting with him alone at the Stray Sheep , with Orlando sending a fake invitation to a friendly reunion and Boss providing the transportion . Once there , he explains his side of the story , that Catherine was n't real , so technically there was no cheating . While hesitant to accept this ridiculous explanation , Orlando , Jonny and Toby back him up , with Boss providing proof of the supernatural elements . The others step away to give Vincent and Katherine time alone , and while Katherine bursts into tears , Vincent says that even if Catherine was n't real , he was still cheating in his heart . He begs for forgiveness , says that his life has no meaning without her , and finishes , `` I will hold you dear for the rest of our lives . Will you marry me ? '' Katherine replies , `` I guess ... I 'll consider it . '' As the camera pans out , both show themselves to be very happily relieved and surprised . The scene returns to the Stray Sheep a few months later , where Boss introduces `` the bride '' for the cheer - and the bride turns out to be Katherine , clad in a wedding dress , wearing her hair in a bun and without her glasses . She and Vincent have just been wed and are holding their reception at the Stray Sheep with Boss presiding as MC . After the credits roll , Vincent 's friends then subject Katherine and him to the traditional kiss call - and despite blushes , they oblige . She leans close and passionately tells him , `` I love you so much , Vincent ... '' She pulls away , and he replies just after the screen fades to black , `` And I love you ... Katherine . '' [ 3 ] Katherine Good : Vincent tricks Katherine into meeting with him alone , with Orlando sending a fake invitation to a friendly reunion and Boss providing the transportion . Once there , he explains his side of the story , that Catherine was n't real , so technically there was no cheating . While hesitant to accept this ridiculous explanation , Orlando , Jonny and Toby back him up , with Boss providing proof of the supernatural elements . Katherine agrees to give it another shot with Vincent . A few months later , Katherine and Vincent are unclothed in Vincent 's bed , Katherine sitting on top on him looking through a wedding dress magazine . She nags Vincent about putting together the list of his wedding guests , which he still has yet to do . After ignoring Vincent 's pleas to get off him as she is crushing him , she decides to go out to grab something to eat with him . Afterwards , an ant crawls out the window . [ 4 ] Katherine Bad : Vincent tricks Katherine into meeting with him alone at the Stray Sheep , with Orlando sending a fake invitation to a friendly reunion and Boss providing the transportation . Once there , he explains his side of the story : that Catherine was n't real , so technically he did not cheat at all . Although Katherine does trust his words , she senses that he only wants the excitement . Despite Vincent 's pleading , Katherine tells him there is no second chance for them to be together again , and bids farewell . Vincent is consoled by Boss , encouraging him to give it more time , and Orlando and Jonny , telling him that he is already free from commitment and can date again , which puts Boss off . However , these do little to comfort Vincent , and says he will be okay without her . Exhausted from all the nightmares , Vincent falls asleep at the table . While at it , his pals accompany him for a round of drinks . Unlike most other endings , there are no pictures shown after credits . Instead , Katherine is heard tapping her finger onto the table ( as how she shows her irritation whenever Vincent does not pay attention ) and snaps him out of it by saying , `` Hey , where 'd you go ? '' . This is reminiscent of the game 's prologue scene at the Chrono Rabbit . [ 5 ] During the Freedom endings , Jonny mentions asking Katherine out after their breakup . Though the fate of that is somewhat vague , his reaction implies she turned him down . Quotes Edit Texts `` Like I said before , I 'm having dinner with some old friends . It 's surprising ... Most of them are already married , and almost half of them have kids . They 're all showing off pictures of their families and it makes me feel left out .

'' `` Um ... Can I meet you for lunch tomorrow ? You do n't need to reply to me now . Just meet me at the cafe for lunch . I 'll be there ... Please come . Good night .

I wanted to talk to you a little more , face-to-face . '' `` I. . . I 'm ... really confused right now ... I mean , you 've been acting really strange this week . This has never happened before . I 'm worried about us ... '' `` Eat that piece of cake I gave you , or it 's going to get stale . I know we could n't talk much yesterday . I 've been busy with work , and it 's hard to make time . I might not be able to pick up the phone sometimes ... I 'll give you a call soon . '' `` What 's going on ? Vincent ... Have you gotten involved in something bad ? If that 's the case , tell me . Tell me the truth . Your problems are my problems now . '' `` Can I trust you ? How can I believe what you 're saying ... ? I hate to have to say that , but you were being weird at lunch . I 'm sorry , but I 'm not so gullible that I can just believe whatever comes out of your mouth . I need to hear the truth from you . We 're going to be sharing our lives together ! '' Catherine `` It 's so hard to tell what you 're thinking sometimes ... '' ( to Vincent ) `` See ya . '' `` Who 's that ... ? '' ( seeing Catherine for the first time ) `` We 're going inside and you 're going to tell me exactly what 's going on here . '' ( to Vincent ) `` So ... if I 'm not mistaken , it would appear you have another woman in your life , yes ? '' `` If you 're going to make excuses , can you at least look me in the eye ? '' `` I thought you were acting a little weird recently , but THIS ? '' `` What are you saying ? And I do n't want to hear any more of your bullshit .

I 've been with you this long ... Of course I noticed ... '' `` Snap out of it ! Vincent ... I came here to break up with you . '' `` When I thought I was pregnant , I was scared the entire tine ... But I thought ... maybe you 'd be happy for me ... '' ( Katherine cries ) '' ... None of that will change anything ... There 's nothing left between us , so do n't call me . '' `` It 's over ... between us . What you want is `` excitement . '' It 's written on your face . I 'm going now . Goodbye . '' ( in her Bad Ending ) The Trivia for Tonight ... Edit Fist of Grudge in the Prison of Despair . Doom 's Bride in Quadrangle . In unused dialogue , Erica mentions Katherine likes kids , and so is probably happy about the pregnancy . [ citation needed ] In unused dialogue , Orlando mentions that Katherine had a pet caterpillar when she was younger . [ citation needed ] Atlus held a Katherine versus Catherine poll . Although the competition was close , Katherine won with a slight edge . [ 6 ] Catherine is written as \u30ad\u30e3\u30b5\u30ea\u30f3 ( Kyasarin ) in Japanese for both Catherine and Katherine . This leads to a lot more ambiguous references in the Japanese game , as the player must rely on context which C/Katherine is being talked about . In a few instances in the English version , the vagueness of which one Vincent is talking about is so important , the localization team altered the subtitles to read as `` her '' when he actually speaks her name , leaving the player intentionally confused . She plays a very large part of Vincent 's fears , manifesting herself in the Nightmare stages as the Fist of Grudge and Doom 's Bride . She has an impressive sweet tooth . Every time ( except Day 6 ) that she is at Chrono Rabbit , she is eating cake , usually strawberry , with her milky coffee . Katherine represents the black haired and mature looking woman in which a man has to choose between her or a blonde and young looking woman ( Catherine ) in one of the Lovers Arcana tales . Katherine represents the romantic and intellectual attraction shown by how she is towards Vincent in the game . Katherine and Catherine share the same English voice actors with Yukari Takeba ( Michelle Ruff voices Katherine and Yukari ) and Rise Kujikawa ( Laura Bailey voices Catherine and Rise ) , the characters who represent the Lovers Arcana ( as Lovers Social Links and dating interests ) in Persona 3 and Persona 4 , respectively . Both games are related to Catherine . Katherine 's four toes . The last name `` McBride '' obviously alludes to the fact that she wants to get married to Vincent . Doom 's Bride also hints at this . In one of her phone images , Katherine inexplicably only has four toes . Either this is simply an animation goof , or Katherine is oligodactyly . Makoto Niijima of Persona 5 can dress as Katherine . Katherine bears a resemblance to Makoto 's sister Sae . Physically , they have long light-colored hair , black outfits with turtlenecks and pants , nail polish , and high heels . They are also workaholics and somewhat manipulative women . Gallery Edit Art Edit Katherine . Katherine . Katherine . Katherine as the background on the Official Web Site .

Photo : Reuters Pakistan 's sporting decline has left the vast South Asian nation that once prided itself on producing the world 's best hockey and squash players facing up to an Olympics for which none of its athletes have qualified . While cricket remains a wildly popular game in Pakistan , a nation of almost 200 million people , most other sports have shrunk in popularity as the successes of the 1980s and early 1990s have become a distant memory . In dilapidated gyms and crumbling sports fields , Pakistani athletes lament the dated equipment and obsolete training methods which leave them struggling against foreign foes who adhere to the latest science-based techniques . Female athletes have an even bigger mountain to climb : Most young girls in the deeply conservative Muslim nation are pressured by their families to stop exercising in public , while those with family backing face the wrath of their communities . `` We are behind the rest of the world , '' said Inam Butt , a Pakistani wrestling champion who won gold at the 2010 Commonwealth Games . `` Our budget , training and facilities are just nothing . How can we compete ? '' Butt , like other athletes , says the future will remain bleak until Pakistan 's government starts pouring money into sport . The seven participants due to represent Pakistan at next month 's Rio Olympics have all been given wildcard entries and stand `` no chance '' of winning medals , according to Arif Hasan , the Pakistan Olympic Association president . `` They are more or less going for the participation and gaining the experience . Let 's hope next time will be better , '' he said . OUTDATED METHODS Those in charge of promoting sport in Pakistan despair . The grassroots system is almost non-existent , children in schools rarely play a sport which is not cricket , and top athletes seldom compete against the world 's best as cash-strapped federations can not afford to send them abroad . Waqar Ahmed , deputy director of the Pakistan Sports Board , said federations also can not afford to hire top coaches familiar with scientific training techniques and end up relying on Pakistani trainers with `` obsolete '' methods from the 1980s . `` Athletes are really frustrated because ... the coaches are not literate and they have been teaching what they were taught 30 years back , '' he said . `` Without infrastructure we can do a lot , but without the techniques you can not win . '' The demise of hockey , Pakistan 's national sport , has been painful to watch for an older generation who prospered during the halcyon days between 1960 and 1994 , when Pakistan regularly won Olympic gold medals and world championships . Tahir Zaman , Pakistan hockey team coach , said the lack of government support means many young athletes no longer see a future in sports like hockey where top players get US$ 10 per day . Pakistani cricketers , by contrast , are paid US$ 5,000 monthly retainers and make a fortune from sponsorship deals . `` The attraction is not there anymore . The [ government ] is not offering regular jobs for players , '' said Zaman , who won a bronze playing for Pakistan at the 1992 Olympics . At Lahore 's empty 45,000-seat hockey stadium , Pakistani hockey player Hassan Anwar , 21 , said that as a teenager his family begged him : `` Please do n't play hockey if you want a bright future . '' The demise of hockey has been mirrored by the decline in the Pakistani squash scene , where young players know all about 1980s legend Jahangir Khan -- considered the greatest ever squash player -- but none match his bravura on the court .", "date": "2016-07-16 16:03:59", "url": "http://taipeitimes.com/News/sport/archives/2016/07/17/2003651207", "phase": "E", "title": "OLYMPICS : Pakistan hits qualifying low point - Taipei Times", "names": [{"name": "arif hasan", "ids": ["Q2234596"], "offsets": [[292, 294]]}, {"name": "waqar ahmed", "ids": ["Q18016135", "Q21642210", "Q27051175", "Q57024634", "Q59490566"], "offsets": [[381, 383]]}, {"name": "tahir zaman", "ids": ["Q7675519"], "offsets": [[512, 514], [590, 591]]}, {"name": "jahangir khan", "ids": ["Q741690"], "offsets": [[668, 670]]}]}, {"articleID": "2015032513_00024251_W", "content": "Jason Derulo is on TINDER !

The 39-year-old singer/songwriter - whose father was late Beatles legend George Harrison - had a large collection of ` Star Wars ' toys when he was a child as he was obsessed with the sci-fi franchise . One day , Dhani decided it was time the X-wing pilot went on an expedition into space , but when Luke came back to earth he found the figure 's right hand had been burned off , which is similar to what actually happens to the Jedi Knight in ` Episode V : The Empire Strikes Back ' . Speaking to StarWars.com , Dhani said : `` I 'm a toy collector , definitely . I remember when I was young enough to be still playing with my X-wing pilot Luke toy , and I wanted him to go into space because I did n't think he was authentic enough just being in my living room . So I managed to get hold of a bottle rocket or something . I was very , very young at the time , and I know that this is probably not allowed . `` And I taped him to this rocket and set him off with a parachute that I 'd made for him . Believe it or not , he actually went really high and came down on a flaming parachute because , obviously , the paper had caught fire from the rocket .

In the 1920s , the Rugby Bears who represented their nation and University hailed from local towns like Berkeley ( Colby `` Babe '' Slater ) , Alameda ( Charles Tilden ) , San Francisco ( Ed `` Mush '' Graff ) and Vallejo ( George Dixon ) . In 2016 , the town of Pacifica was added to that list when 2013 alumnus Danny Barrett emerged as a global entity at the Rio Summer Olympics , where he was a vital member of the 12-man squad . Barrett scored four tries for the United States during the three-day tournament at the Olympics , tallying scores against Argentina , Brazil , Spain and eventual gold medalist Fiji . When the Games concluded for Rugby 7s on August 11 , Team USA took a traditional lap around Deodoro Stadium to show appreciation to the fans , which included a contingent of family and friends wearing Team Barrett T-shirts . Danny climbed up into the stands and embraced his mother , Keri , father , Tim , and aunt Colleen . The international community , meanwhile , had also embraced Barrett , whose bruising and beautifully skilled commitment to the game in Rio was impossible to miss . The New York Times took note of Barrett 's nickname , The Beast . `` Passionate , '' described the San Francisco Chronicle . World Rugby , the international governing body , called him `` the human wrecking ball [ who ] is possibly one of the most spoken about players . '' Back home in Berkeley , the Cal Athletics community was overjoyed , though unsurprised , by the recognition Barrett had earned . `` Danny was not only one of America 's best players , he was one of the better rugby performers at the Games , '' said head coach Jack Clark . `` I 'm hopeful collegiate student-athletes all over the U.S. will decide to follow his path and that Danny 's story is aspirational to their journey . '' Barrett himself said he needed time to reflect on the enormity of his journey , which has seen him go from a national champion and four-time All-American in Blue and Gold to a key member of the U.S. National Team setup in both 15s and 7s , a role that has allowed him the historic opportunity to compete in the Rugby World Cup and the Olympics over the last 12 months . `` It 's amazing , '' Barrett offered . `` You really ca n't explain what it 's like to be out there playing in front of the world . '' When the Bears return to campus later this month to begin the program 's 135th year as the oldest intercollegiate sport at the University of California , student-athletes and staff will begin a quest to pursue PAC Rugby and postseason glory with an added gleam of pride that comes with having seen one of their own shine on the Olympic stage . As Barrett enjoys a well-earned rest before resuming his rise as a global rugby phenomenon , everyone in the Cal Athletics family is emboldened by the accomplishments of this great Golden Bear .

( PTI ) Ranchi : Shami Ahmed was the lone bright spot for India in the abandoned fourth ODI against Australia , on Wednesday . Playing his first match of the series , Shami was almost unplayable as he merrily swung the ball in both directions . He got three wickets on the day and all three came off superb deliveries . However , at the media conference , Shami came off as a very chilled customer , completely detached from the great work that he did on the field . Asked if the overcast conditions and the pitch helped him in his endeavour , Shami answered in the negative . `` No there was nothing extraordinary in the pitch for the bowlers . Like most fresh wickets , it was initially helping the fast bowlers . `` There was bounce and carry which I exploited ... But the mini rain-break after the first six overs somehow changed the nature of the pitch ... It was n't giving the same bounce and carry ... And had also become a little slow , '' he said . While Shami was giving the Australian batsmen all sorts of trouble , his new ball partner , Jaydev Unadkat , too , complemented well , keeping it tight at the other end . What was the plan ? `` Nothing special ... We just decided that we should n't give any room to their batsmen ... Especially , Aaron Finch . It was a fresh wicket and we were bowling first , so we had the opportunity to use these factors to our advantage and deny them any room . We wanted to make them play as many deliveries as possible and that turned out to be beneficial for us , '' Shami said . Ignored for the first three matches of the series , common sense says that there was some pressure on him to do well to justify his selection . But the Bengal pacer denied it . `` It does n't really matter ... Whether I 'm playing my first match of the series , whether it is my home ground , or stuff like that . `` When I 'm selected , it is my job to give my best . I was n't under any pressure ... I only think about my line and length , because at the end of the day that will earn me wickets . '' The deliveries which castled Aaron Finch and Shane Watson had classic swing written all over them .

The source also told the online tabloid that the events quickly turned ugly while the ladies were in the middle of the production . According to the source , Dorit Kemsley came to the set ready to go after her co-stars Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave , Camille Grammer , and Kyle Richards . The source also mentioned that Kemsley 's husband P.K. also joined her during the filming , which means that someone took her side during that time . The cameras also caught the drama between Mellencamp Arroyave and Ericka Girardi , whose feud intensified on social media after the episode where the ladies were at each other 's throats was aired . This means that their bickering will also level up in the reunion special . In her recent blog entry for Bravo , Mellencamp Arroyave called out Girardi for liking a Twitter post from a netizen who wanted her to be kicked out of the show . `` You can be shady all you want ( as I know I can be ) , but co-signing that you wish another woman would lose her job does n't scream ` you go , girl ! ' in quite a positive way , '' the 36-year-old former equestrian stated . But while her castmates were reportedly caught in major drama , Lisa Vanderpump reportedly took a backseat this season and avoided joining the catfights . `` Lisa has been so busy with her restaurants , '' the source also said . `` She just did n't have the energy or desire to engage with the petty antics of the ladies , '' the insider went on to share . Bravo airs the latest episodes of `` The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills '' season 8 every Tuesday at 9 p.m. EDT .", "date": "2018-03-22 19:59:10", "url": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/the-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-news-fight-erupts-during-filming-of-season-8-reunion-special-221904/", "phase": "E", "title": "` The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills ' News : Fight Erupts During Filming of Season 8 Reunion Special", "names": [{"name": "beverly hills", "ids": ["Q4899544", "Q923258"], "offsets": [[5, 7], [49, 51], [69, 71], [449, 451]]}, {"name": "camille grammer", "ids": ["Q2034653"], "offsets": [[204, 206]]}, {"name": "kyle richards", "ids": ["Q1853959"], "offsets": [[208, 210]]}, {"name": "lisa vanderpump", "ids": ["Q15040601"], "offsets": [[380, 382], [395, 396]]}]}, {"articleID": "2014120301_00045969_W", "content": "Use another account with your email account Almost Done ! { * #socialRegistrationForm * } { * socialRegistration_firstName * } { * socialRegistration_lastName * } { * socialRegistration_emailAddress * } { * socialRegistration_displayName * } We have sent a confirmation email to { * traditionalRegistration_firstName * } { * traditionalRegistration_lastName * } { * traditionalRegistration_emailAddress * } { * traditionalRegistration_password * } { * traditionalRegistration_passwordConfirm * } { * traditionalRegistration_displayName * } Enter your email and we 'll send you a link to reset your password . { * traditionalSignIn_emailAddress * } We did n't recognise that password reset code .

Missing 16-year-old from Milton Keynes : Police launch appeal Chief constable of Thames Valley Police quits force Dual carriageway linking Milton Keynes and Cambridge welcomed by city MP Milton Keynes travel : A5 northbound closed after accident Attempted cashpoint robbery in central Milton Keynes HMP Woodhill not in lock down - Ministry Of Justice ` It is vital Milton Keynes moves on after taxi-gate ' Reaction to proposed cuts to Milton Keynes ' services : ` It 's appalling ' Karl Robinson remained tight lipped about his MK Dons side 's promotion chances after a smash-and-grab victory over Sheffield United on Tuesday night . Dele Alli 's 86th minute winner was enough to snatch all three points for Dons at Bramall Lane in the 1-0 win - a victory which sees Dons climb to third in the table , now just a point off the automatic promotion spots . But with just 17 games under their belt , there 's still a long way to go in the season , even if some are beginning to wonder whether this is finally the season . Robinson though still believes there are bigger teams in the division who could flex their muscles in January to make life harder for Dons in the final furlongs . `` People have been speaking about that for a while , '' he said . `` We need to have a really good look at what we want to do in January . `` The group is very strong . We can play with class and style and we can dig deep . I do n't know how much people wanted to be here last season , but everyone wants to be here now . `` People look at us , respect us and consider us a team to beat , but we 're still not one of the big four . Far from it . `` We 're always up there and knock on doors . We 're a team people want to beat , but you 've seen a different side to us , one that I have n't seen in a while . These results are bigger than the 6-0 results . '' It was n't a vintage Dons performance at Bramall Lane , but it was a performance borne out of necessity . With United hot on Dons ' heels in League 1 , and the best part of 17,000 voices urging them on from the sidelines , Robinson 's side set out to do what they had to to take something from the game . And right up until Alli 's late strike , Dons looked more than happy to take a share of the points back with them down the M1 . After that , Dons had to indulge in the uglier side of football to get home safely . Clever fouls in innocuous positions , bookings - though in Danny Green 's case , two bookings and his marching orders - and general time wasting were the order the final 10 minutes , prompting a hostile reception from the home support as Dons celebrated their win at the final whistle . `` We did n't deserve to win , '' admitted Robinson afterwards . `` We were n't great tonight , but you ca n't always be as good as we were on Saturday . `` They 're a very good side , managed by a very good manager . `` I know we got booed at the end , but we did what we had to do at the end of the game , and we rolled our sleeves up . I wo n't apologise for my players putting their bodies on the line . `` We have n't done it often enough - come to a big team and win . That 's as good as it gets . `` People have commented on my sides being pretty on the eye but have n't been able to dig results out . * Please type the postcode as the example above Local news on the move Keep up to date with all the latest local news on your iPhone or Android phone with our mobile site .

Your weather is set to STATE COLLEGE -- It really was n't all that long ago , the spring of 2013 , that Trevor Williams was new to defense at the college level , new to corner , and eventually the target of opposing passing attacks come that fall . The Baltimore native came to Penn State as a receiver , catching 10 passes as a freshman and returning four kicks . Then , in his second spring in blue and white , he stopped being a receiver and starter defending them . His first season was up and down ; by mid-year , he was no longer a starter . That rough patch is far in the rear view mirror , though . Come August , and Penn State 's season-opener against Temple , the rangy defensive back is set to begin his second straight season as a starting cornerback in Bob Shoop 's defense . `` It 's just been a learning experience ; not getting down on myself , talking to guys from the previous teams , '' Williams said Wednesday . `` Adrian Amos [ was ] definitely like a big brother to me , and just working hard on the field and off the field has helped me out a lot . '' Williams , who has put on 10 pounds of muscle this winter and now stands 6-foot-1 , 196 pounds , had to work hard to get on the field in his first year on defense , at least after Penn State was blown out at Ohio State two years ago . The following week , Amos moved up to corner , and Stephen Obeng-Agyapong , who played just about every where that season , slid back from linebacker to safety . The moment was likely shocking for Williams , then a sophomore , but now is merely a blip on his career 's radar . Williams made 12 starts a year ago ( he missed the Temple game ) , finishing with 27 tackles and two interceptions playing opposite Jordan Lucas . It was a successful season , but as Williams ' career arc shows , change is possible in any college football program regardless of results . He and Lucas made a dynamic pair , but now the latter is back at safety ( replacing Amos , of course ) , meaning Williams will likely play opposite a different corner for the third straight year . `` Grant Haley , he 's stepped up this spring , he 's doing a lot of great things , '' Williams said when asked about the contenders for Lucas ' old job . `` Daquan Worley , he 's showing some improvement ; a lot of the young guys , Christian Campbell , Jordan Smith , Daquan Davis , the whole secondary room , we 're working together , and [ corners ] Coach [ Terry ] Smith has been helping us out a lot . '' The group vying for snaps at corner is long , and also inexperienced . Haley saw the most snaps of anyone hoping to start a year ago , but head coach James Franklin has pointed out Worley 's and Campbell 's performances this spring . Smith and Davis are veterans who have played sparingly on defense during their time in blue and white . Older players , like Amos , helped Williams anyway they could , and he 's hoping to return the favor . He knows a thing or two about bumpy roads and competition leading to quality production , and if he can use his past hardship to make the starters and contributors on the opposite side of the field from him better , Penn State 's defense has a chance to be better , too . h1 > ` Nittany Insider ' Get the latest in Penn State sports in your inbox daily from PennLive.com .

He told The Sun newspaper : `` Craig is entitled to his opinion but he is always looking to push himself because no one gives a s ** t about him when ` Strictly ' is n't on . `` That 's what Craig does . So I 'm not surprised he has condemned a brand new format - without even seeing the first episode .

'' Jason - who is joined by ballet legend Wayne Sleep and Spice Girl Mel B on the ` Stepping Out ' panel - insists the show offers viewers a completely different experience to their BBC competitors because the celebrities are teamed up with their real-life partners rather than professional dancers . He said : '' ` Strictly ' sticks to ballroom dancing - it 's very technical and has to be executed precisely , although Len Goodman is the only judge with ballroom experience . `` Our show is about how our couples deal with the challenge of dancing together , and learning lots of different types of dance like tap , street and bhangra . `` It is a lot more ambitious , because a professional partner acts as a huge safety net . Most of the time , a pro dancer can make an amateur look good . `` But take a pro out of the equation like we have done , and the celebrities are extremely exposed and vulnerable .

'' The Islamic State 's graphic ( and ongoing ) last stand in Mosul included `` dozens of suicide bombers -- including women with babies in their arms '' and house-to-house searches `` for young boys they could force into battle , '' The Wall Street Journal reports this morning from Mosul . One father even hid his three sons in `` full niqabs , the black face coverings worn by conservative Muslim women , when Islamic State came looking . '' Also in Mosul : allegations of extrajudicial killings of alleged ISIS militants posted to Facebook earlier this week . AP has the story , flagged by Human Rights Watch , here . The group 's final days in Mosul yielded a story of immense courage : an Iraqi special forces soldier allegedly `` donned a smock and scarf , before sneaking past the Islamist group 's heavily guarded defences '' and killed half a dozen ISIS fighters -- before delivering coordinates to his fellow Iraqi soldiers on ISIS snipers , machine gun nests and ammo caches . That , anyway , is the story according to The Independent . A worrisome forecast for rising temps on the tarmac . In the years ahead , rising temperatures across the planet are likely to mean `` aircraft fuel capacities and payload weights will have to be reduced by up to four percent on the hottest days for some aircraft , '' AFP reports off a new study published in the journal Climatic Change . The implications for travelers : `` A four-percent weight reduction could mean 12 or 13 fewer passengers on an average 160-seat aircraft operating today . '' It 's not a distant thought , either .

A seven-year inquiry concluded on Wednesday that former British Prime Minister Tony Blair 's justification , planning and handling of the Iraq War involved a catalog of failures , but did not rule whether the war was legal . Eight months before the 2003 invasion , Blair told former U.S. President George W. Bush `` I will be with you , whatever , '' eventually sending 45,000 British troops into battle when peace options had not been exhausted , the long-awaited British public inquiry said . Try Newsweek for only $ 1.25 per week Prescott , writing in the Sunday Mirror newspaper , said he had now changed his view about the legality of the war and criticized Blair for stopping his ministers from fully discussing in advance whether the war would be legal . `` In 2004 , the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that as regime change was the prime aim of the Iraq War , it was illegal . With great sadness and anger , I now believe him to be right , '' Prescott wrote . Britain 's former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott arrives for a weekly cabinet meeting at Downing Street in London May 4 , 2006 . Reuters `` I will live with the decision of going to war and its catastrophic consequences for the rest of my life , '' he added . Many Britons want Blair to face criminal action over his decision to take military action that led to the deaths of 179 British soldiers and more than 150,000 Iraqi civilians over the following six years . `` The Attorney General , Lord Goldsmith , came to the Cabinet , verbally announced it was legal , but provided no documentation , '' Prescott said . `` The timing of the decision was clearly designed to endorse an almost immediate action for us to go to war . '' Prescott added that he backed the decision by Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn -- a veteran anti-war campaigner and critic of Blair -- to apologize for the war on behalf of the party . Meanwhile , a cross-party group of lawmakers said they would seek next week a vote declaring Blair in contempt of parliament for misleading it in the run-up to the decision to go to war . `` Saying one thing to George W. Bush in private and a totally different thing to parliament and people in public , that is the parliamentary crime , the offence , and it is time for parliament to deliver a verdict , '' Scottish National Party lawmaker and former party leader Alex Salmond told ITV television . The possible implications of such a vote were not immediately clear , but the Sunday Times newspaper said it could see Blair barred from public office or stripped of his membership of the Privy Council , a largely ceremonial body that advises Queen Elizabeth .", "date": "2016-07-10 15:31:20", "url": "http://www.newsweek.com/deputy-pm-prescott-iraq-war-illegal-479186", "phase": "E", "title": "UK former deputy PM John Prescott says he now believes the Iraq war was illegal Reuters", "names": [{"name": "john prescott", "ids": ["Q332393", "Q58166586", "Q58166598"], "offsets": [[7, 8], [43, 45], [158, 159], [241, 242], [250, 252], [356, 357], [382, 383]]}, {"name": "tony blair", "ids": ["Q9545"], "offsets": [[20, 22], [75, 77], [110, 111], [182, 183], [298, 299], [403, 404], [432, 433], [529, 530]]}, {"name": "president george w. bush", "ids": ["Q207"], "offsets": [[115, 118], [456, 459]]}, {"name": "kofi annan", "ids": ["Q1254"], "offsets": [[206, 208]]}, {"name": "jeremy corbyn", "ids": ["Q291169"], "offsets": [[393, 395]]}, {"name": "alex salmond", "ids": ["Q10652"], "offsets": [[502, 504]]}, {"name": "queen elizabeth", "ids": ["Q9682"], "offsets": [[550, 552]]}]}, {"articleID": "2016021717_00039213_W", "content": "Rain , snow head for California after days of record heat - KOAM TV 7 Rain , snow head for California after days of record heat - KOAM TV 7 Member Center : Roads Rain , snow head for California after days of record heat ( AP Photo/Lenny Ignelzi ) .

The National Weather Service says that winds will increase throughout Wednesday with rains starting mid-afternoon in the San Francisco Bay Area . `` It 'll be a wet commute tonight , so be patient and allow extra time to get home , '' forecaster Steve Anderson in the service 's Monterey office said . `` It 's still wintertime . '' After three days of record-breaking heat , a new system brings a quarter-inch to a half-inch of rain to most parts of the region Wednesday and Thursday . The system is expected to drop between 1 and 2 feet of new snow in California 's highest peaks , the National Weather Service said . Beaches in Southern California were crowded after the holiday weekend saw record-breaking heat from Los Angeles to San Diego . The high in downtown Los Angeles hit 90 degrees on Tuesday , breaking the old record of 88 for the day that was set in 1977 , according to the weather service . San Diego 's high of 89 was 8 degrees above the 1981 record . The airport in San Francisco recorded 72 , beating a 2007 high . Meanwhile , the East Coast and the South struggled through a deep freeze and tornadoes . A treacherous mix of snow , sleet and freezing rain caused car crashes from the Mid-Atlantic states through Pennsylvania to northern New England on Tuesday , a day after twisters tore through parts of the South . At least three deaths were reported on slick roads , all in Virginia , and thousands were left without power from weather-caused outages . Phoenix was also had record high temps . Tuesday 's high topped out at 87 degrees , which broke the previous record of 84 set in 2014 . The NWS is forecasting a high of 90 degrees for Wednesday in what would be the earliest 90-degree day on record for the desert city . The normal temperature for this time of year is in the 70s . The previous mark was set on Feb. 24 , 1986 . Phoenix also saw record highs last week . The surge in temperatures has been bringing rattlesnakes out of hibernation . A fire agency in southern Arizona started getting calls in the last two weeks from panicked residents about the poisonous snakes on their yards and patios , something they do n't usually see until late March and early April .

'' for now , he 'll hope to win that championship as a key young piece on a roster full of talented veterans . but any titles beyond the next few years will depend a great deal on how much more rondo can develop . no other celtic is currently under contract as long . rondo 's five-year extension will actually begin next season , meaning he 'll be wearing a boston uniform until the summer of 2015 , outlasting the current deals for ray allen , paul pierce and kevin garnett - likely bridging the gap from one generation of the celtics to the next . until rondo 's arrival , the celtics had long searched for a legitimate point guard to lead their team on the floor . whether it be veterans past their prime ( gary payton , kenny anderson ) or supposed projects ( marcus banks , sebastian telfair , j.r. bremer ) , until rondo came to boston , it 's fair to say the celtics had n't had a star at the position since dennis johnson . and in the danny ainge era , so many point guard experiments never panned out that it was no surprise when the celtics swung a deal in the 2006 draft to acquire rondo from phoenix , who selected him with the 21st overall pick . head coach doc rivers said he was `` really happy '' for rondo and glad to get the contract talks over with , but there 's still work to be done . `` nothing changes for him , '' rivers said . `` he still wants to get better . he needs to keep getting better , working on his game to improve it . he 's earned what he has , but this ca n't be the defining moment of your career . winning has to be the defining moment , just getting better has to be it . this is a great part of his early career . that 's how i look at it . '' that 's the one thing that might have been lost on rondo in all of this , at least in how its played out in the media . this is n't it for him . he 's still just 23 years old , and even though he 's got a championship ring , he 's yet to be an all-star . he wanted to be recognized and paid as such , but he 's still got plenty left to accomplish . this deal is it shows the celtics do think he 's an upper-echelon player , something that did n't seem the case this offseason . with danny ainge publicly stating that rondo was n't a max contract-type of player and with head coach doc rivers sitting down with his point guard to tell him his teammates do n't like playing with him , the issues went beyond just showing up late for a playoff game . it seems as though those concerns are in the past , and rondo is now financially secure for the rest of his life - with the chance for another big deal when he 's entering the prime of his career at 29 years old . `` i do n't want to be greedy , '' rondo said . `` i 'm thankful what i 'm signing for . it 's a lot of other things you can put in consideration with my teammates , the amount of money they make , cap room . i do n't need to take the whole thing . we need to continue to get great players in here and that 's what they 'll do . i do n't want , like i said , to take all the money , even if i think i deserve it . at times you have to sacrifice and at other times it 's about the team .

Public Enemy No. 1 Manny Machado earning right to be Boston 's next great villain Chris Mason CNHI Sports Boston 6 hrs ago AP photoBaltimore Orioles third baseman Manny Machado . Charles Krupa Associated PressBaltimore Orioles ' Manny Machado flips his bat after striking out to Boston Red Sox starting pitcher Drew Pomeranz during the first inning of Wednesday 's game . BOSTON -- The growing chasm between the Red Sox and Orioles has featured ejections , head-hunting and plenty of bad blood . It 's also showcased the birth of Boston 's next great villain : Manny Machado . The Orioles superstar has been at the epicenter of the Sox and Orioles clash from the outset . He 's grown into his villainhood as things have progressed , and earned his baptism by boos this week at Fenway Park . The whole feud began two weeks ago in Baltimore when a late slide from Machado injured Dustin Pedroia . The spiking can be explained away innocently enough . There 's no way to determine his intent , and it 's hard to prove that it was anything more than a reckless slide . Beyond a reasonable doubt anyway . Two days later , Matt Barnes threw a fastball at Machado 's head . The Orioles third baseman was furious , but kept his cool . Machado lost it when the teams were reintroduced in Boston . In his first at-bat on Tuesday night , Sox ace Chris Sale threw behind Machado . The purpose pitch prompted a rant for the ages . `` What do you think ? [ Expletive ] [ expletive ] . [ Expletive ] [ expletive ] [ expletive ] . Coward stuff . I mean , that 's stuff that you do n't [ expletive ] do . But I 'm not on that side , not in that organization , '' Machado said . `` They are still thinking about that same slide . I had no intention on hurting anybody and I 'm still paying -- trying to get hit at . Getting thrown at my [ expletive ] head , you 're throwing at [ expletive ] everywhere . It 's [ expletive ] [ expletive ] . It 's [ expletive ] [ expletive ] . I 've lost respect for that organization , for that coaching staff , for everyone over there . '' He was n't finished . `` If you 're going to [ expletive ] hit me , hit me , go ahead , '' Machado said . `` Do n't let the [ expletive ] keep [ expletive ] lingering around and keep trying to [ expletive ] hit people . It 's [ expletive ] [ expletive ] . MLB should do something about it . [ Expletive ] pitchers out there with [ expletive ] balls in their hands throwing 100 mph trying to hit people . I 've got a [ expletive ] bat too . I could go up there and crush somebody if I wanted to . But you know what ? I 'll get suspended for a year and the pitcher only gets suspended for two games . That 's not cool . '' The diatribe could n't have made his hatred for the Red Sox any clearer . But it was his on-field response that made him befitting the boos . Later in Tuesday 's game , Sale threw Machado a first-pitch fastball that caught too much of the plate . Machado tattooed it over everything in left field , and broke into a home run trot so slow that molasses may have lapped him as he rounded second . When Machado crossed home plate , he shot a look back over his shoulder , catching eyes with Sale . His point was made . He 's a player that can talk the talk , and walk it walk . To be one of Boston 's greatest enemies , you have to be great . Roger Clemens was a Cy Young winner . Alex Rodriguez was an MVP . Machado is on the way to becoming one too . He hit .297 last season with 37 homers and 96 RBI and won a Gold Glove . He might be the best two-way player in baseball , winning games wherever he is on the field . More importantly , this series with the Sox has showed that he is n't going to turtle when the temperature turns up . What makes this even more entertaining is the fact that his latest beef was with Sale , who is proving to be every bit the nasty competitor Pedro Martinez was . Sale , as we speak , is entering cult-hero status only a month into his career here . You know he is n't going to back down to anybody , including Boston 's new whipping boy . While Red Sox fans gave Adam Jones a standing ovation the night after the `` racial '' issue he had with fans , Machado 's spikes to Pedroia 's knee has earned him only boos . Lots and lots of boos . Yankees legend Reggie Jackson famously said , `` They do n't boo nobodies . '' No they do n't . And Machado is proving to be someone worth booing at Fenway Park .

The Bora-Hansgroghe rider surged at the right time to upstage Norway 's Alexander Kristoff and German riders John Degenkolb and Marcel Kittel . Australia 's Michael Matthews was fifth in the mainly flat 190-kilometer ( 118-mile ) stage from Chablis to Chalon-sur-Saone , across eastern Burgundy . Sam Bennett , of Ireland , celebrates on the podium after winning the third stage of the Paris Nice cycling race between Chablis and Chalon-sur-Saone , France , Thursday , March 7 . ( AP Photo/Laurent Cipriani ) France 's Arnaud Demare had to settle for sixth but he retained his overall leader 's yellow jersey before a decisive time trial in Mont Brouilly on Wednesday . `` I was full of confidence , I had a good feeling in my legs and I was looking for an opportunity . With the support of the team , I was able to do it , '' the 26-year-old Bennett said after the most significant victory in his career to date . `` To be honest , I fought for my position to be in the front and I did n't really notice what the other sprinters were doing . '' Demare , who won the opening stage , keeps the overall lead , six seconds ahead of fellow countryman Julian Alaphilippe .

'' Two-time champion Alberto Contador from Spain is still 1:18 behind Demare in the overall standings , while Richie Porte of Australia looks unlikely to win a third Paris-Nice title , after falling more than 15 minutes behind the yellow jersey .

Oh , the freedom ! The thrill ! The independence to wear your favorite stripes , plaids and floral patterns , individually or all at once . It did n't really matter whether the articles matched ; the main thing was that you 'd picked them out and put them on all by yourself . These days , however , perhaps you , like me , have found this daily chore has become a little tiresome . Instead of excitement and adventure , your dresser and closet , like mine , present one bewildering question after another . Does this blouse match this skirt ? When was the last time I wore that shirt ? Can these pants pass for clean ? Friends , if you too have fallen victim to the dressing doldrums , read on . I 've recently found renewed enthusiasm for self-adornment , and maybe you can , too . It 's all thanks to our good neighbor , Synchlora aerata . Also known as the camouflaged looper , this caterpillar falls into the category of Fairly Common But Rarely Seen , thanks to its ability to `` dress itself '' using fragments of petals from its host plants . That 's right , folks , this little larva picks out pieces of plants and adheres them to its back using sticky silk . It 's not just a one-and-done effort , either . Because the bits tend to wither and wilt rather quickly , the caterpillar has to `` change clothes '' frequently -- or else risk getting eaten . Talk about a great motivator ! The camo looper is a member of the moth family Geometridae , a large group with more than 35,000 species worldwide and about 1,400 species in North America . The name is derived from the Latin geometra , or earth measurer , a term that refers to the caterpillar 's peculiar way of moving around . Looping up , then stretching out , these guys inch along on leaves and branches , earning their other common name , inchworm , every step of the way . ( Fun fact : Inchworms are n't just showing off . Other types of caterpillars , which move with more of a shuffling motion , do so because they have five sets of prolegs -- fleshy appendages that protrude from their abdominal segments . Five pairs of prolegs mean these caterpillars have lots of gripping power , which permits the larva to move forward in a rippling wave of motion . Inchworms , aka loopers , in contrast , have only two pairs of prolegs , located at the rear of the body . They must draw their hindquarters up toward the head , then reach forward in order to `` inch '' along . ) Cool locomotion aside , looper caterpillars also are hairless , which means they 're ideal prey for many types of insectivores . While some loopers rely on color or posture for defense , the camo looper is the only species in our area that goes that extra mile and attaches plant bits to enhance its disguise . The species is n't particularly fussy about host plants and can be found on many species of asters , black-eyed susans , blazing stars , boneset , goldenrods , raspberries , roses and St. John 's worts . Camo loopers will even venture into non-native territory and conceal themselves on chrysanthemums , daisies , yarrow and Queen Anne 's lace -- which is where `` Good Natured '' readers Alice DuBois and Tim Campbell found their looper a couple of weeks ago . `` I noticed a little worm that looked identical to the white flower part of the plant , inching up and down , '' Alice said in an email . At first perplexed , she did some research and discovered the amazing dress-up talents of Synchlora aerata . Provided its camouflage is effective , the little looper will grow to a length of a little over half an inch , before pupating and emerging with a completely different look -- and name : the wavy-lined emerald moth . These small ( wingspan less than 1 inch ) moths often appear at porch lights on warm evenings and can be identified by their pastel green wings with undulating ( `` wavy '' ) lines . The next time you 're faced with a clothing conundrum , remember the lessons learned from our friend the camo looper . Pick pieces that go together , add a touch of silk and keep them fresh . Most important , dress for success and always remember : If you do n't get eaten , you know you 're doing it right .

Creators of the SAT exam announced plans Wednesday to toughen the test in the face of stagnant national scores , planning to challenge students to provide more analysis , cite evidence and even turn in their calculators before answering some math questions . The new version will be first administered in 2016 . `` It is time for an admissions assessment that makes it clear that the road to success is not last-minute tricks or cramming but the challenging learning students do every day , '' said David Coleman , president of the non-profit College Board , which produces the SAT , originally known as the Scholastic Aptitude Test . The SAT is a rite of passage for high school students seeking admission to college . Many -- but not all -- universities require SAT scores as part of the admissions process . About 1.6 million students take the exam each year , and only 43 % of the high schoolclass of 2013 scored high enough to succeed in college , according to a College Board analysis . U.S. students have fallen behind their counterparts in many other developed nations in test results , prompting concerns that the USA is insufficiently preparing young people for competing in a global economy . The SAT last underwent a redesign in 2005 . The freshly overhauled test includes a more challenging essay assignment scored on the strength of analysis as well as writing . But the score for it will not be part of the final overall test result . Colleges can choose whether to consider it . As a result of this change , the top score for the new SAT will drop from 2100 to 1600 . Carol Jago , a high school teacher in Santa Monica , Calif. , and past president of the National Council of Teachers of English , hailed the redesign as a better way to test whether students are prepared for the demands of college curricula . `` I think it 's more authentic , '' she said , `` by insisting that a student not only get a right answer , but demonstrate how they get a right answer . '' While the scope of the exam has been narrowed in areas such as math and vocabulary , what remains requires more demanding problem-solving -- what Coleman described in remarks released Wednesday as `` doing a few things very well . '' In analyzing reading passages in the exam , students must cite specific passages from extracts of well-known writings to support answers , something not necessary in the current version . The new test will include science , history or social studies source documents that students will be required to analyze or draw citations from to support answers . `` We are not interested in students just picking an answer , but justifying the answer , '' Coleman said . Cited works included in the SAT for students to evaluate will hopefully be more familiar than documents included in current SATs , the College Board said . The new version will draw from milestone documents such as the Declaration of Independence or the Bill of Rights , or crucial speeches such as the Gettysburg Address or Dr. Martin Luther King 's `` I Have a Dream . '' Coleman promised that the vocabulary requirements would be pared down to avoid the current version 's tendency to ask about `` a word you have not heard before and are not likely to hear again . '' Vocabulary included in the revised exam will be words more often used and words that also have more complex , multiple meanings .

'' News of Kennedy 's death has been on the mind of the organization all week . `` He was just here for the draft , '' Payton said . `` All of us are devastated . ... It just was so sudden , and it 's tough . ... As great a player as he was -- and trust me , if you had to pull a starting lineup out of the Hall of Fame on defense , he 's in the starting lineup -- he was that good a guy . '' A.J. Klein started at MLB | Mike Triplett Some other lineup/attendance notables during Saints OTA practice Thursday : A.J. Klein started at MLB ( though Manti Te'o still rehabbing ) . Newly-signed vet Josh LeRibeus at center in place of injured Max Unger . Senio Kelemete and Bryce Harris split time at LT while Terron Armstead watched from the side . P.J. Williams started at CB opposite Delvin Breaux . Rookie S Marcus Williams spent time with first string in three-safety alignment . DE Hau'oli Kikaha did some individual work as he rehabs from ACL . WR Willie Snead was present but did not participate . DT Nick Fairley did not appear to be in attendance . Undrafted former Georgia Tech QB Justin Thomas lined up as a WR . Veteran Josh LeRibeus getting a look at center for Saints this summer with Max Unger out | theadvocate.com `` It was really just the ballhandling , just learning how to snap , '' LeRibeus said . `` Because at guard , you just block the guy , so now you have a little extra aspect , but my whole thing is repetition . '' LeRibeus spent the entire 2016 season as a free agent , but with Unger 's injury -- the Saints ' starter is expected back near the end of the preseason -- there 's an opening this summer to potentially fight for a roster spot . Veteran Tim Lelito , who backed up Unger last year , left for Tennessee in free agency , and Kelemete is the offensive line 's sixth man . Marshon Lattimore is trying to circumvent what can be a hard learning curve for rookie cornerbacks | theadvocate.com So , it should n't be a surprise that first-round pick Marshon Lattimore did n't have a perfect showing during his debut practice before the media . He was never targeted during Thursday 's organized team activity and appeared to be in phase on each route he defended , but there were other moments when he looked like a rookie trying to figure things out . One of those moments came late in the session when he failed to pick up his receiver coming out of the huddle , and the play had to be restarted . Lattimore was affixed to the right side of the field , and by the time he saw his guy lining up to the left and made his way over it was too late . `` My confidence level is at an all-time high , '' Breaux said Thursday after Saints organized team activities . `` I 've worked my behind off this offseason just to know that it 's time to be that Pro Bowl or All-Pro type guy . `` I just been working , man , and feel great . '' Can Okafor Give the Saints Pass Rush an Edge ? \u2022 Saints News Network Okafor can play standing up or with his `` hand in the dirt '' , and it 's probably likely that the Saints will make him the new ` official ' starter at that spot right out the gate ; although he 'll more than likely fill a situational role as part of a 3-man rotation and no doubt will have to show everyone that he can avoid the nagging injuries that constantly plagued him with the Cardinals . For Saints fans however , the addition of Okafor is looked at in a bit more simpler terms , which is : Can Okafor be the `` complementary '' player on the opposite side of All-Pro defensive end Cam Jordan that the team has lacked since the departure of former defensive end Junior Galette ; and give their pass rush `` an edge '' that it has been sorely lacking for the past few seasons ? Adrian Peterson working on pass-catching skills , and other Saints OTA observations | NOLA.com The Saints played primarily nickel defense throughout the practice . It looked like the familiar 4-2-5 defense we watched most of last season . Alex Okafor , predictably , manned the defensive end spot opposite Cam Jordan . Sheldon Rankins and David Onyemata took snaps with the first unit with Nick Fairley and Tyeler Davison not practicing .

That 's according to a report by an independent watchdog agency , The report , issued by the VA Inspector General ( IG ) found that more than 21,000 homeless veterans in fiscal year 2013 were n't able to contact VA counselors and 3,000 were not referred to a VA medical facility , even when they provided all of the necessary information . Rather than providing a human voice , the call center relied on answering machines instead of counselors , and the VA IG added that it `` could not account for a significant amount of the counselors ' time , '' the Beacon reports . The report noted that counselors spent large amounts of time unavailable to answer calls during peak call times . This resulted in 40,500 missed opportunities where the call center either did n't refer the veterans ' calls to medical facilities , or it closed referrals without making certain that homeless veterans received the services they needed from VA medical facilities , Fox News reports . `` In our opinion , the majority of these calls could have been answered by counselors , instead of the answering machine , '' the report stated . It also said that 85 percent of the records reviewed by the IG lacked documentation to show that the veterans had received the support services they needed , The report also found that counselors working at the center `` often did not log in or did not spend the entire day logged into the call center telephone system . '' But the report is merely a drop in the bucket for what has been a terrible year for the VA , long mired in controversy after several other reports showed mistreatment of veterans -- including hidden wait lists -- at VA hospitals nationwide . The influx of reports resulted in the resignation of former VA Secretary Eric Shinseki , who started the Zero Homelessness Initiative in 2009 . New VA Secretary Robert McDonald is following up with this , and the goal is to completely eliminate veteran homelessness by 2015 , The Fiscal Times reports .

'' and then my wife said the same thing when i got home . couture : why would n't you come back ? it 's not like you had to have your arm twisted . i was ecstatic to hear there was going to be a 2 , and to hear rumblings there might be a 3 is awesome . stallone : doing a film like this is like having a dinosaur as a house pet - you know it 's going to be extinct pretty soon , so enjoy it while it 's here . rocky iv , could you imagine doing an action film 30 years later ? stallone : no . i mean , you had the fantasy , but the reality hit that the business is so ferociously competitive now and so unforgiving . i have a feeling that they would never make rocky today . they may not even make first blood - first blood sat on the floor for five years . everyone passed on it . i was the 11th choice . after i did the movie , i said , ` my career 's over . ' that genre had n't been done yet : the man against his own country , the one-man-army thing . so i thought i was done . i literally tried to buy back the film and burn it , for real . so who knew ? lundgren : physical shape is important , too . these guys are in great shape for their age , and if you 're not in shape , we could n't do it . but does your training regimen change for the rigours of an action movie ? stallone : it definitely intensifies for me . these guys work out much harder during the film than i do , but i try to front-load . i get in the best shape that i can and then have smaller workouts because i know it 's going to be diminishing returns . every day , i 'm going to get a little weaker , but if i come in in really good shape , i 'll make it to the end . crews : i treat the film as a camp . we were in eastern europe , i had no family , i was 100 per cent all this movie . i would study my lines , go over them again , work out in the morning , and then i 'd do it all again in the afternoon . anybody can be in shape , but you want people to understand your character . acting is a discipline . couture : i was already in shape , still training and competing , and it becomes part of your lifestyle . it 's who you are , the things you do . lundgren : you focus a little more on the visual when you 're filming because you want to show off a little more . you try to stay in shape and live through it . stallone : the ultimate first action films , of course , are seven samurai and yojimbo and the japanese classics . they were where i was first aware of bringing guys together , and then they did american takeoffs , like crews : i did n't come up in the dirty dozen days , but enter the dragon was in my formative times . as a kid , i never saw anything like that . , and what set the tone for my action career was tootsie ( starring dustin hoffman in drag ) . i got in touch with my sensitive side . if i had to wear a dress , that would be really violent . how key is male camaraderie to a movie like this ? stallone : it 's very important . if there 's one actor who has his own agenda and he 's not a team player and he 's dragging his lines and he 's blowing his takes and he 's arriving two hours late , it can throw such a negative spin on the whole process . crews : women bond through good times where men bond through pain.we were all sitting there like , ` man , i miss my family ' . you 're watching pain happen to your castmates , but what happens is you realise these guys are taking hits for the team . it 's like in the nfl - when you watch somebody get de-cleated , you get a respect for the guy . stallone : when we 're sliding down high-tension wires with one arm , it sounds like , hey , no problem , but by the sixth take , think about it : you 're 200 pounds , you 're hanging with one arm , and with the momentum and the g-force , after a while it gets old . especially if you 're like us and have worn rotator cuffs . i literally can not lift a four-pound pistol - i have to switch hands . these stunt guys , it 's very dangerous because it 's not been done and will never be done again . ( terry 's ) smashing a guy 's head into a pillar and the timing is critical , otherwise the guy will die for real . i know it must be very frustrating sometimes to work with green screen . i wish some of the younger actors could come into our world and just work under real conditions . i would n't know how to do it any other way . let 's say sly is psychic and expendables is rebooted in 20 years . who 's in it ? stallone : oh , my god ! i think the hemsworth brothers ( liam and the avengers ' chris ) could definitely be in it . who would play me ? lundgren : i could do the chuck norris part . stallone : it 's hard to say because you do n't know if you 're going to be around in 20 years . crews : they 're all on disney channel now . stallone : they have n't gone through puberty yet . call me in 10 years .", "date": "2012-08-22 22:16:03", "url": "http://telegraphindia.com/1120823/jsp/entertainment/story_15884229.jsp", "phase": "C", "title": "grandpa gang on the go", "names": [{"name": "sylvester stallone", "ids": ["Q40026"], "offsets": [[0, 2], [73, 74], [105, 106], [154, 155], [280, 281], [569, 570], [808, 809], [858, 859], [1035, 1036], [1263, 1264], [1392, 1393], [1521, 1522], [1718, 1719], [1759, 1760], [1792, 1793]]}, {"name": "arnold schwarzenegger", "ids": ["Q2685"], "offsets": [[75, 77], [107, 108], [166, 167]]}, {"name": "chuck norris", "ids": ["Q17083833", "Q2673"], "offsets": [[78, 80], [116, 117], [216, 217], [1755, 1757]]}, {"name": "dolph lundgren", "ids": ["Q181678"], "offsets": [[81, 83], [170, 171], [291, 292], [460, 461], [633, 634], [988, 989], [1228, 1229], [1749, 1750]]}, {"name": "bruce willis", "ids": ["Q2680"], "offsets": [[84, 86]]}, {"name": "jean-claude van damme", "ids": ["Q308840"], "offsets": [[87, 90]]}, {"name": "van damme", "ids": ["Q33697207"], "offsets": [[218, 220], [325, 327]]}, {"name": "jason statham", "ids": ["Q169963"], "offsets": [[247, 249]]}, {"name": "terry crews", "ids": ["Q271464"], "offsets": [[250, 252], [299, 300], [406, 407], [533, 534], [688, 689], [1117, 1118], [1304, 1305], [1448, 1449], [1629, 1630], [1782, 1783]]}, {"name": "randy couture", "ids": ["Q352733"], "offsets": [[255, 257], [307, 308], [509, 510], [762, 763], [1196, 1197]]}, {"name": "liam hemsworth", "ids": ["Q32045"], "offsets": [[258, 260], [1728, 1729], [1731, 1732]]}, {"name": "dustin hoffman", "ids": ["Q42930"], "offsets": [[1352, 1354]]}]}, {"articleID": "2014012922_00094113_W", "content": "Indian inflation is so much higher than global inflation that 5 % depreciation in the rupee per year is permissible , and probably inevitable .

Abdullah , a Union Minister , told journalists that Omar , who is said to be thinking of resigning over the issue , would take the final call on the alliance . But , he said , there is a need to resolve the matter amicably because creation of administrative units is for the good of the people and by this way , the work done by the former Chief Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad of creating eight districts will be completed . `` This is not going to benefit one party but credit will go to both the parties , '' Abdullah said . To a question on whether the two parties would be fighting elections together , he said `` no final decision has been taken on this '' . Asked whether there was a growing mistrust between NC and Congress , Abdullah shot back , `` there are some people with vested interests who are trying to create mistrust between the coalition partners .

Torrential rain deluged swaths of drought-hit California on Tuesday , bringing floods and traffic accidents across the state and prompting evacuations amid fears of destructive mudslides . After a scorching drought which is the worst in California since records began , a powerful storm front lashed the region from the southern border with Mexico to the northern boundary with Oregon . A large truck was left dangling over a highway overpass in one accident while the celebrity enclave of Malibu was left isolated after rains knocked over power lines and forced the closure of roads leading to the coastal town . Up to 10.16 cm of rain was expected to be dumped across parts of the region , with hillside communities feared to be most at risk of mudslides after years of drought which have stripped slopes of stabilising vegetation . In the Los Angeles suburb of Glendora and communities of Camarillo and Silverado Canyon , more than 120 people were evacuated over fears of mudslides . `` With the rain , it 's just moving it down the hill where nature wants to take it , '' Camarillo Springs resident Barbara Williams told KTLA 5 local television . `` Unfortunately , we have some homes in the way of where nature wants to go . '' Local television showed residents frantically laying sandbags around properties in an effort to protect homes in the event of mudslides . Los Angeles County Fire Department deputy chief Steve Martin warned residents in hillside communities not to risk staying in their homes if required to evacuate . `` We know it 's an inconvenience , we know it 's hard to leave your homes behind , but the fact of the matter is if the mountains does cut loose , it happens so fast you 're already behind , '' The Los Angeles Times quoted him as saying . Several neighbourhoods in Los Angeles were given a record soaking , with the 2.9 cm dumped on the city 's downtown surpassing the old mark of 2.79 set on December 2 , 1961 , according to the National Weather Service .

N > bought online retailer Jet.com for $ 3 billion last year , it marked a crucial moment - the world 's largest brick-and-mortar retailer , after years of ceding e-commerce leadership to arch rival Amazon , intended to compete . On Friday , Amazon.com Inc < AMZN . O > countered . With its $ 14 billion purchase of grocery chain Whole Foods Market Inc < WFM . N > , the largest e-commerce company announced its intention to take on Wal-Mart in the brick-and-mortar world . [ nL3N1JD3Z4 ] The two deals make it clear that the lines that divided traditional retail from e-commerce are disappearing and sector dominance will no longer be bound by e-commerce or brick-and-mortar , but by who is better at both . Amazon 's purchase of Whole Foods also brings disruption to the $ 700 billion U.S. grocery sector , a traditional area of retailing that stands on the precipice of a ferocious price war . German discounters Aldi and Lidl are battling Wal-Mart , which controls 22 percent of the U.S. grocery market , with each vowing to undercut whatever price the others offer . The stakes are highest for Wal-Mart . Amazon 's move aims at the heart of the Bentonville , Arkansas-based retail giant 's business - groceries , which account for 56 percent of Wal-Mart 's $ 486 billion in revenue for the year ending Jan. 31 . With the deal , Whole Foods ' more than 460 stores become a test bed with which Amazon can learn how to compete with Wal-Mart 's 4,700 stores with a large grocery offering that are also within 10 miles ( 16 km ) of 90 percent of the U.S. population . Amazon is expected to lower Whole Foods ' notoriously high prices , enabling it to pursue Wal-Mart 's customers . The push comes as Wal-Mart is headed in the opposite direction - going after Amazon 's higher-income shoppers with a recent string of acquisitions of online brands such as Moosejaw and Modcloth and on Friday , menswear e-tailer Bonobos . Wal-Mart may be ready . In preparation for the grocery price war , Wal-Mart in recent months has cut grocery prices , improved fresh food and meat offerings , modernized shelving and lighting in its grocery aisles , and expanded its online grocery pickup service . [ nL2N1GC03L ] [ nL1N1ID07D ] [ nL2N1IJ0D3 ] Marc Lore , the Jet.com founder who now runs Wal-Mart 's e-commerce business after selling a startup to Amazon , told Reuters in an interview that Amazon 's move does not change Wal-Mart 's game plan . `` We 're playing offense , '' he said . Wal-Mart is offering curbside pickup of online grocery purchases at 700 locations , with 300 more planned by year end . It also is testing same-day fresh and frozen home delivery from 10 of its stores . `` We see an opportunity to do a lot more of that , '' Lore said . Roger Davidson , who oversaw Wal-Mart 's global food procurement and now is president of Oakton Advisory Group , said the deal will reduce Wal-Mart 's brick-and-mortar advantage . `` I think this acquisition is a concern , '' he said . Some industry observers say Amazon will find it difficult to use Whole Foods to pull away Wal-Mart shoppers because the two stores appeal to different customers . But Michelle Grant , head of retailing at market research firm Euromonitor , said Amazon could use an obscure part of the Whole Foods portfolio - Whole Foods 365 - to lure Wal-Mart shoppers . Whole Foods 365 offers private-label goods and lower prices than typical Whole Foods stores , and is targeted at younger , value-conscious shoppers . Amazon could provide the financial capital and tactical ability to build that into something big . `` That ( Whole Foods 365 ) may become a big problem for Wal-Mart , '' Grant said . Amazon , which reported $ 12.5 billion in cash and equivalents and a free cash flow of $ 10.2 billion in the year ended March 31 , has plenty to spend . Wal-Mart reported $ 6.9 billion in cash and equivalents and $ 20.9 billion in free cash flow at its year ended Jan. 31 . Brittain Ladd , a former senior manager at Amazon who worked on its brick-and-mortar strategy , said Amazon will use Whole Foods to test concepts for the grocery store of the future . Ladd , who left Amazon in March , said Amazon will seek to eliminate checkout lines by using technology that automatically scans goods as customers add them to their shopping carts . It will select merchandise based on Amazon 's vaunted customer data , and potentially expects the use of technology to change prices during the course of a day . Amazon declined comment on competition with Walmart but spokesman Drew Herdener said in a statement the company has no plans to cut jobs or use technology in development at its Seattle Amazon Go store to automate jobs of cashiers . Ladd , who helped with AmazonFresh 's global expansion and now is a supply chain consultant , said an Amazon-owned Whole Foods also likely will offer in-car pickup of online purchases , and home delivery from Whole Foods stores , add pharmacies and showcase Amazon devices inside the stores . `` Amazon will reduce prices and change the assortment of products carried in Whole Foods stores to attract a larger customer base , '' said Ladd . `` Kroger and Wal-Mart will be impacted as their customers will defect to Amazon .

Beijing : China today said the Doklam standoff posed a `` major test '' for bilateral ties with India and lessons should be learnt from it to avoid a similar situation of its kind in future . The comment came ahead of the 20th round of India-China border talks which are expected to be held this week in New Delhi between National Security Advisor ( NSA ) Ajit Doval and China 's State Councillor Yang Jiechi , who are designated Special Representatives . Though the talks are scheduled for December 22 , an official announcement has not been made yet from both sides . The two sides attach significance to this event as it would be the first round of talks since the 73-day-long standoff in Doklam ended on August 28 . `` This Special Representative meeting is not only a high - level channel for the border issue discussion but also the platform for strategic communication , '' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told reporters today . This also allows the two sides to exchange views on the international and regional issues of major concern , she said . `` In 2017 , China-India relations have maintained a good momentum generally but the Doklam incident posed a major test for the two countries . We should learn lessons from this incident to avoid any further conflict of this kind in the future , '' Hua said . `` We should follow our historical conventions on the border to uphold the tranquillity and peace in the border region ... `` Hua said the Doklam issue also figured in the recent visit of Foreign Minister Wang Yi to New Delhi to take part in the foreign ministers ' meeting of Russia , India and China . Wang held talks with External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and President Ram Nath Kovind . Wang in his meeting with Ms Swaraj also touched the Doklam issue , Hua said . Officials say Wang 's visit , the first by a top Chinese official after the Doklam standoff and the starting of the second term of Chinese President Xi Jinping in October , facilitated a more candid and frank talks between the two countries to tide over most contentious issues . In June , Chinese soldiers who began constructing a new road were stopped by Indian troops who crossed over the border at Sikkim . The new road would give Beijing access to a thin corridor that connects India to its northeastern states . In August , both sides agreed to withdraw their soldiers from the face-off site at Doklam .", "date": "2017-12-19 11:10:04", "url": "https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/lessons-should-be-learnt-from-doklam-standoff-china-1789645?pfrom=home-india", "phase": "E", "title": "Must Learn From Doklam To Avoid Future Conflict , Says China", "names": [{"name": "yang jiechi", "ids": ["Q58211"], "offsets": [[143, 145]]}, {"name": "hua chunying", "ids": ["Q630111"], "offsets": [[232, 234], [305, 306], [330, 331], [393, 394]]}, {"name": "wang yi", "ids": ["Q15932545", "Q16761688", "Q19856060", "Q24862862", "Q3377225", "Q45362970", "Q45365249", "Q45366078", "Q45380924", "Q45390101", "Q45425687", "Q45429019", "Q45429157", "Q45429905", "Q45429976", "Q45430089", "Q45430100", "Q45430139", "Q45430146", "Q45430201", "Q45430445", "Q45430586", "Q45430843", "Q45430888", "Q45431252", "Q45432263", "Q45432751", "Q45433689", "Q45435777", "Q45438173", "Q45439039", "Q45440374", "Q45440619", "Q45441141", "Q45441358", "Q45441846", "Q45442720", "Q45444153", "Q45444479", "Q45449266", "Q45450958", "Q45451889", "Q45453602", "Q45456208", "Q45458273", "Q45460179", "Q45461385", "Q45461492", "Q45463127", "Q45463252", "Q45463313", "Q45464397", "Q45464678", "Q45467325", "Q45468288", "Q45470135", "Q45470350", "Q45471531", "Q45473275", "Q45473300", "Q45473712", "Q45474981", "Q45476893", "Q45477133", "Q45477197", "Q45477783", "Q45478126", "Q45482098", "Q45482651", "Q45484195", "Q45484788", "Q45484851", "Q45485172", "Q45487005", "Q45487323", "Q45488065", "Q45489663", "Q45489920", "Q45494057", "Q45494122", "Q45495824", "Q45495899", "Q45497431", "Q45498725", "Q45498891", "Q45500643", "Q45501596", "Q45503837", "Q45503903", "Q45505099", "Q45506593", "Q45510291", "Q45510922", "Q45511242", "Q45512097", "Q45517622", "Q45518994", "Q45519248", "Q45522397", "Q45522579", "Q45522897", "Q45523020", "Q45524384", "Q45525774", "Q45526117", "Q45526169", "Q45526264", "Q45526515", "Q45526559", "Q45526577", "Q45528290", "Q45529863", "Q45531596", "Q45533096", "Q45533724", "Q45534699", "Q45537901", "Q45537914", "Q45542700", "Q45544139", "Q45545442", "Q45546857", "Q45546989", "Q45547491", "Q45549586", "Q45551972", "Q45553665", "Q45557159", "Q45562351", "Q45562575", "Q45563542", "Q45564252", "Q45564924", "Q45565099", "Q45565936", "Q45566677", "Q45566812", "Q45567198", "Q45568662", "Q45569083", "Q45570277", "Q45570414", "Q45571257", "Q45574576", "Q45575912", "Q45577451", "Q45577513", "Q45577557", "Q45578837", "Q45582397", "Q45587318", "Q45588697", "Q45588985", "Q45589792", "Q45593967", "Q45596729", "Q45597277", "Q45597933", "Q45598381", "Q45599612", "Q45600048", "Q45602481", "Q45603757", "Q45604894", "Q45606237", "Q45607692", "Q45610171", "Q45610336", "Q45614214", "Q45615809", "Q45616313", "Q45620206", "Q45624357", "Q45624969", "Q45625084", "Q45626718", "Q45627280", "Q45627918", "Q45628746", "Q45631319", "Q45633270", "Q45634561", "Q45635419", "Q45635523", "Q45635598", "Q45635761", "Q45638288", "Q45643990", "Q45644206", "Q45644720", "Q45645937", "Q45647421", "Q45648130", "Q45649054", "Q45649114", "Q45650832", "Q45653345", "Q45653992", "Q45654195", "Q45655152", "Q45655407", "Q45655965", "Q45656791", "Q45656851", "Q45657131", "Q45658647", "Q45658937", "Q45660908", "Q45660968", "Q45661026", "Q45661086", "Q45661744", "Q45662466", "Q45664007", "Q45664062", "Q45664115", "Q45664170", "Q45664279", "Q45664332", "Q45664387", "Q45664815", "Q45665897", "Q45666235", "Q45666555", "Q45667659", "Q45667814", "Q45669071", "Q45673037", "Q45675163", "Q45675682", "Q45675927", "Q45676301", "Q45676611", "Q45676790", "Q45676907", "Q45677479", "Q45678142", "Q45678761", "Q45679097", "Q45679522", "Q45680963", "Q45683246", "Q45683871", "Q45693876", "Q45697186", "Q45699725", "Q45704592", "Q45705277", "Q45706438", "Q56008821", "Q701801", "Q705734", "Q7967716", "Q7967717", "Q7967720", "Q9058743", "Q9065465"], "offsets": [[344, 346], [365, 366], [380, 381], [398, 399]]}, {"name": "sushma swaraj", "ids": ["Q1652493"], "offsets": [[372, 374], [386, 387]]}, {"name": "ram nath kovind", "ids": ["Q16845347"], "offsets": [[376, 379]]}, {"name": "xi jinping", "ids": ["Q15031"], "offsets": [[423, 425]]}]}, {"articleID": "2012081005_00070314_W", "content": "japan 's ` steel carnations ' win hearts in defeat like this story , share it with millions of investors on m3 japan 's ` steel carnations ' win hearts in defeat by alastair himmer tokyo ( reuters ) -

'' the practice of selling patents and retaining the rights to share in lawsuit proceeds probably will grow as early innovators in mobile-phone development , such as nokia and ericsson , lose market share to the likes of apple and samsung electronics . it can also make it hard to figure out who actually owns a patent . the u.s. patent and trademark office planned a meeting last week to discuss possible rules requiring more disclosure about the `` real party in interest '' in patents and applications . `` every large company is selling patents today , '' said ron epstein , chief executive officer of patent brokerage epicenter ip group . `` when they are selling , they are looking for the best possible price , '' he said . `` does an intelligent manager of a resource called a patent have a responsibility of getting the highest possible return for these assets , or do they have to worry about how it will harm competitors ?

' '' mobilemedia owns patents that originated with nokia , sony and mpeg , the licensing administrator for a pool of patents used by consumer electronics-makers . those three retained a stake in mobilemedia , according to a june 21 , 2010 , filing in the apple case . a federal jury in delaware found on dec. 13 that apple 's iphone infringed three patents held by mobilemedia . a second trial will be held to determine how much apple should pay . research in motion , which makes the blackberry phone , lost a swedish arbitration court case in november challenging mobilemedia 's right to sue . rim and nokia announced a licensing deal dec. 21 that resolves other litigation . the mobilemedia case is continuing . alcatel-lucent set up a fund called multimedia patent trust to hold lucent patents . a jury on dec. 13 cleared apple and lg electronics of the trust 's infringement claims . microsoft and nokia will get a share of licensing proceeds from nokia patents transferred to a canadian firm , mosaid technologies . google filed a complaint with european regulators in june saying the mosaid agreement improperly thwarts competition . `` often we do not have the resources or otherwise are not best positioned ourselves to exploit those inventions , either through our own products or through our own licensing activities , '' said paul melin , nokia 's chief intellectual property officer . `` divestments of patents have become a very important channel for us to monetize and realize the value of our research and development . '' melin said the company has transferred patents more than 20 times over the past five years , many going to companies whose main business is to derive licensing revenue . david cuddy , a microsoft spokesman , and mary ward , an alcatel-lucent spokeswoman , had no comment . the changing ownership of a patent can make it hard to determine who benefits from a lawsuit . in a case against google and aol in alexandria , va. , a judge confronted what he called the `` increasingly common but always vexing '' question of who has `` all substantial rights '' to a patent . that information is needed , district judge t.s. ellis said , to make sure the firm that brought the case , suffolk technologies , had standing to sue . suffolk technologies is owned by a group that includes goldman sachs , general atlantic partners and boston consulting group , the judge said . the patents originated with bt 's british telecom , which transferred them with an agreement it would get at least half the proceeds from the patent , according to the judge 's dec. 7 opinion . laurie said he has heard speculation that some patent owners create offshore companies to blur connections to licensing firms . `` it sounds like a spy novel , '' laurie said . `` all sorts of creative models are being designed for this .

That 's what differentiated these victorious Washington Capitals and the downtrodden Pittsburgh Penguins on this night . Mere centimetres . A sliver of white ice between the red goal line and the black puck that needed to be reviewed via video to be acknowledged as a goal . The winning goal . The overtime goal . T.J. Oshie 's hat trick goal . The goal that gave the host Capitals a 4-3 victory over the Penguins in Game 1 of this best-of-seven second round playoff series that has all the makings of a classic . Coming into this matchup , there was little to choose from between these star studded teams . To that end , they did n't disappoint . On this drizzly Thursday evening , the only thing that separated the Penguins and Capitals was an Oshie wraparound that barely squeezed between the post and the pad of Penguins goalie Matt Murray . `` The way their ` tender plays , he 's a big guy and plays aggressive , we thought we might have a chance if we tried to go to the far post , '' Oshie said , referring to Murray . For his part , Murray initially protested that the puck had not gone in . Asked if he thought he had stopped it , Murray replied : `` Yeah I did , to be honest . The ref called it a goal on the ice . I do n't know how he could have possibly seen it from his angle . But I thought I had it , to be honest . `` I knew it was close but I thought it never fully crossed the line . I thought it was close enough that it would be inconclusive . But I 'm not going to go any further than that . '' This series has been billed as Crosby-Ovechkin II with good reason , given that the NHL 's two poster boys are clashing in the playoffs for only the second time in their post-season careers . Of course , when an event is hyped up like this , it often does not live up to expectations , instead disappointing with a resounding plop . Think many heavyweight fights . Think many Super Bowl blowouts . That was n't the case on Thursday night in Washington , however . On a drama-filled evening full of storylines , it was one of Ovechkin 's understudies -- Oshie -- who stole the show . In a script right off the pages of a Hollywood screenwriter , Oshie completed his three goal perforamnce with the winner at 9:33 of overtime . Game 2 , which goes Saturday night here in Washington with the Capitals leading the series 1-0 , will be shown to a national TV audience south of the border on NBC . And if it proves to be anywhere near as riveting as the opener , it will be an outstanding selling point for the league of just how exceptional the product can be at this level . While Ovechkin was a force , Crosby certainly could have been better . In fact , the Penguins best player was Nick Bonino , who had a goal and an assist . Andre Burakovsky scored the other Capitals goal while Bonino , Ben Lovejoy and Evgeni Malkin replied for the Penguins . Murray appeared to favour his right leg after stopping an Ovechkin breakaway in the third period but was able to continue . Meanwhile , count on the league to review a knee-on-knee hit delivered by the Caps ' Tom Wilson on the Pens ' Conor Sheary in the third period . As bad as the play looked , no penalty was called , leaving the Penguins livid . In the first 10:37 of this series , the teams combined for 17 shots , an Burakovsky goal , a Chris Kunitz effort that pinballed off the post and a partial Ovie breakaway . Other than that ... And so , the Caps hold the upper hand . So , what can we expect for an encore in Game 2 ? `` Games like that with teams with that amount of skill , anytime you give them time and space , it seems that they can make some plays , '' Capitals goalie Braden Holtby said . `` We did a pretty good job most of the game taking it away , but it happened once or twice and they can burn you . `` You have to be ready to focus on every single play and execute it . That 's one thing we 're going to get better at . '' One thing is for sure : this series is going to be fun . It already is .

A total of 94 per cent of pupils at St George and St Teresa , Dorridge , achieved the expected standard in reading , writing and mathematics in their Key Stage Two SATs . This is nearly one and a half times the Solihull borough average and over one and a half times the national average . These scores mean that the school is also ranked as one of the top one per cent of state primary schools in the country . The school achieved over three times the national average for pupils gaining the higher standard in Reading , Writing and Mathematics at Key Stage Two . St George and St Teresa was visited by schools minister Nick Gibb only last month and the school claim he aimed to capture what he had witnessed in order to share this with other schools . The school beat national averages across the board with expected standards exceeding the national levels by a substantial margin in reading , writing and mathematics . Also 29 per cent achieved the Higher Standard in reading , writing and mathematics combined compared to 10 per cent in Solihull and nine per cent nationally . The School is rated as Good by Ofsted and as Outstanding by the Diocesan Education Service , which is responsible for directing Catholic schools concerning the development of curriculum provision for Religious Education and strengthening Catholic life . Head teacher Des Foxon attributed the school 's success to a focus on the personal development of every child , working closely with parents and never ceasing to strive to be better . He said : `` We are thrilled with these results , staff and pupils have worked so hard to achieve these . `` The School has at the heart of its work , the personal development of each child . `` These results will ensure that our school leavers are very well equipped for secondary school , and we wish them all the very best as they make that transition . `` Everything we do is about ensuring that the school is better than it was yesterday . `` St George and St Teresa is going from strength to strength . `` Support from parents is so much valued and appreciated . We work in close partnership with our families to make St George and St Teresa School a true community . '' Of his visit , Schools Minister Nick Gibb also said : `` It was a pleasure to see first-hand how the teachers and pupils at St George and St Teresa Catholic Primary School achieve such high academic standards , particularly in reading and in maths , with nearly every child reaching or exceeding the expected standard .

Photo / Richard Robinson Two teenage sisters fought 4m waves to save a man and four children at an unguarded surf beach . Auckland schoolgirls Hannah , 15 , and Lauren Williams , 17 , both off-duty lifeguards , were checking out the surf at Mangawhai Heads on Tuesday when they noticed the group in trouble . They said they were in a pretty dangerous position . `` I ran down and Lauren came with me , '' said Hannah . `` There were three girls and Lauren helped them get back to shore . I swam out to the man and a boy who were getting bashed against the rocks . `` It was 3-4m surf , and really , really dumping . And there was a very strong current . It was not ideal . '' The man and boy , aged about 11 , were out the furthest and the boy was pinned against the rocks by the time Hannah reached them . Three younger girls , thought to be 7-8 years old , were not out as far but were not strong swimmers . Two of them were wearing lifejackets . `` They were struggling , they were n't happy , '' Lauren said . `` I think they would have eventually been pushed in ... and hit the rocks [ as well ] . I grabbed the two with the lifejackets and the other girl I held . I got behind them and pushed them out of the water . It was difficult because the current was so strong but I could still stand . '' Meanwhile , Hannah was dealing with the boy , who had been cut up on the rocks . `` The man was n't quite on the rocks . I swam past him and walked up on to the rocks to the boy . I held him so he was n't getting bashed against the rocks any more . I carried him back to the dad and swam back to shore , '' Hannah said . `` I had the boy under my arm and I was kind of dragging the man behind me . `` If we had n't been there , I think they probably would 've been pushed over rocks and out to sea . They were out of their depth and they did n't really look like they knew what they were doing . '' Once ashore , the sisters received hugs and thanks from the three girls . The man seemed in shock , they said . The group left the beach in a hurry and their identities were unknown to their rescuers . The teens ' mother , Anna Williams , who was at the other end of the beach during the drama , was proud of her girls . `` That 's what lifesaving is all about .

Judge Calls Out Fraud ` Rhetoric , ' Ariz. . Democrat Extends Lead By Jessica Taylor \u2022 12 minutes ago Tweet Share Google + Email Workers load ballots into machines at the Broward County Supervisor of Elections office during a recount on Sunday in Lauderhill , Fla. . Brynn Anderson / AP As recounts are underway in Florida , a judge is issued a warning on Monday to `` ramp down the rhetoric '' as top Republicans -- including President Trump -- are casting doubt on the process . The Associated Press reports that law enforcement and elections monitors have found no evidence of wrongdoing , but Republican lawyers and candidates , along with Trump , have claimed -- without evidence -- that there have been voter irregularities and fraud , in addition to improper behavior by local voting officials , that cast doubt on the integrity of the process . The president tweeted early Monday morning that the elections should be called in favor of Republican Gov. Rick Scott , who 's challenging Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson , and former GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis in his bid for governor over Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum . `` An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected . Must go with Election Night ! '' Trump wrote . With Republicans leading in both the Senate and gubernatorial races , both contests are within the 0.5 percent margin that mandates a statewide recount . Many of the outstanding ballots could be from overseas military personnel , who can have their ballots counted as long as they arrive by Friday and were postmarked by Nov. 6 , and it 's hardly unusual for votes in many states to be counted after Election Day . Broward Circuit Chief Judge Jack Tuter made the comments during an emergency hearing requested by Scott 's attorneys , saying , `` I am urging because of the highly public nature of this case to ramp down the rhetoric . '' `` If someone in this lawsuit or someone in this county has evidence of voter fraud or irregularities at the supervisor 's office , they should report it to their local law enforcement officer , '' Tuter said . `` If the lawyers are aware of it , they should swear out an affidavit , but everything the lawyers are saying out there in front of the elections office is being beamed all over the country . We need to be careful of what we say . Words mean things these days . '' Republicans have cast doubt on the actions of Broward County Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes , questioning why the county has been so slow to count ballots . Snipes has pointed to high turnout and a lengthy ballot . The AP details that during the hearing , Scott 's legal team claimed that Snipes was involved in `` suspect and unlawful vote counting practices '' against state law and that she could `` destroy evidence of any errors , accidents or unlawful conduct . '' They also requested additional sheriff 's deputies to be sent to her office to oversee the ballots and voting machines , including to be present to watch them when they were n't in use . Snipes ' lawyers rebutted that the Scott campaign 's goal was to `` undermine '' faith in the elections , and ultimately the outcome if it does n't go in their favor . The Broward County office already has cameras , deputies and security guards protecting the ballots . The judge ultimately ordered the parties to meet to find a compromise , and three deputies will be added to the Broward elections office . Tuter is n't the only Florida official to register apparent frustration with some of the rhetoric coming from the White House . NPR 's Miles Parks reports that Mark Early , the supervisor of elections in Leon County , said that he did n't want to comment on politics , but did stress that these were public servants who were working hard to ensure every vote is counted fairly . `` You 've got dedicated patriots out there who are going without sleep , to protect democracy and if anyone is out there undermining that especially when they have a role in making sure it 's done well , that hurts our nation , '' the Leon County supervisor said . Georgia counties face deadline In neighboring Georgia , the gubernatorial contest between Republican Brian Kemp , who narrowly leads , and Democrat Stacey Abrams is also drawing scrutiny . According to WABE reporter Johnny Kauffman , Georgia 's recently appointed Secretary of State Robyn Crittenden says the deadline for counties to certify election results is no later than Tuesday at 5 p.m. ET . Kemp stepped down last week as secretary of state , anticipating not only a win but amid criticism that he was overseeing the close count . Throughout their race , Abrams has alleged that Kemp has been trying to suppress minority voters and new registrations . Kauffman reports that in court filings , the state wrote that Crittenden should be able to certify the state election as soon as possible , and any delay would inhibit preparations for upcoming runoffs in December . Meanwhile , the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that the Abrams campaign is trying to find any remaining provisional ballots or other uncounted ballots to push Kemp 's tally below 50 percent , forcing a runoff next month . As of 4:25 p.m. ET on Monday , Kemp had 50.26 percent of the vote . Democrats are also pursuing legal action to force counties to revisit some ballots and try to delay the deadline set by the state until Wednesday . Kemp 's campaign has called such efforts `` frivolous '' and says Abrams should concede . Arizona Democrat expands lead The Senate race in Arizona also remains in limbo . According to the Arizona Republic , with additional ballots being counted Democrat Kyrsten Sinema has now widened her lead over Republican Martha McSally to over 30,000 votes . About 215,000 ballots remain to be counted , but Sinema 's campaign says those come from areas that will favor the Democrat . The count has been delayed because of the need to check signatures from mail-in ballots . If Sinema wins , it would represent a Democratic pick-up of the open seat held by retiring Republican Sen. Jeff Flake . Arizona has not elected a Democrat to the Senate since 1988 . But there 's talk now of both Sinema and McSally going to the Senate , as an Arizona Republic op-ed called on Gov. Doug Ducey to appoint McSally to Arizona 's other Senate seat . Former GOP Sen. Jon Kyl was appointed to fill the term of the late Sen. John McCain , but if Kyl steps down Ducey would need to name another Republican to replace him . Copyright 2018 NPR . To see more , visit http://www.npr.org/ .

This week , Senate Democrats joined the Republican majority to confirm three avowed deniers of climate science into Donald Trump 's cabinet -- Ryan Zinke for Interior , Ben Carson for Housing and Urban Development , and Rick Perry for Energy . Zinke was confirmed on Wednesday , and Carson and Perry confirmed on Thursday . Democrats chose not to use the 30 hours of debate time following the Perry cloture vote , instead allowing his confirmation to occur immediately after . ( That was a caucus-leadership level decision -- aka Chuck Schumer . ) Seventeen members of the Democratic caucus voted for Ryan Zinke ; 11 voted for cloture or confirmation on Carson ; and 12 voted for cloture or confirmation on Perry . In all , 22 Democrats voted at least once with Republicans for these nominees . ( Angus King ( Maine ) is an independent who caucuses with the Democrats . ) Ryan Zinke , now Trump 's Interior Secretary , has voted in the past to sell of thousands of acres of public lands . Now he runs our National Parks , including the rapidly melting Glacier National Park . And he 's called climate change `` not proven science . '' Back when he was running for president , Ben Carson , running Housing and Urban Development , said `` there 's always going to be either cooling or warming going on . '' Now he oversees the nation 's climate-disaster housing relief programs . And Rick Perry , now our Department of Energy head , called climate science `` unsettled '' and a `` contrived , phony mess . '' As Texas Governor and as a presidential candidate , Perry received millions of dollars in campaign contributions from the oil and gas industry . Now he runs our nation 's energy research labs . These votes also set a dangerous precedent for the upcoming battle over the last branch of government not under Steve Bannon 's control -- the judiciary . Senate Democrats still have the power to protect the Supreme Court from a Trump takeover , but as we can see the caucus does n't intend to stand in his way .

The local sheriff , police union officials and district attorney have various theories about what 's behind the body count : 64 homicides by the end of April , compared with 29 killings after the first four months of 2015 ; 75 slayings as of Wednesday , compared with 45 by the same date last year .

Screen Name or EmailRemember me on this computerLogin They cite officer staffing levels ; gang activity ; jail release policies locally and in neighboring California ; and a departmental reorganization after Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo was elected 18 months ago . `` That 's the million-dollar question , '' DA Steve Wolfson said . `` There are lots of theories . '' Lombardo defends his deployment decisions , and concedes that pointing the finger at California jails and criminals is based more on what he calls a gut reaction than on statistics . `` Everybody 's dealing with an increase in violent crime across the nation , '' Lombardo said . `` The question is whether we 're dealing with it more here than anybody else . '' In Washington , D.C. , FBI Director James Comey cited Las Vegas and Chicago as examples of a rise in violence nationally . He said he 'd been briefed about crime rates in more than 40 cities , but he named just two . `` From the Las Vegas Strip you ca n't tell that more than 60 people have been murdered in Las Vegas this year , '' Comey recently told reporters in the nation 's capital . Lombardo , a 25-year Las Vegas police veteran , heads a department with 2,612 sworn police officers covering a city and most of a county with more than 2 million residents , plus more than 40 million visitors a year . `` Officers ' presence makes a difference , '' Lombardo said . `` All the resources we can , within reason , we bring forward to attack violent crime . '' But the image of the safety in Sin City has been shaken several times in recent months : -- A motorist plowed through a crowd of Las Vegas Strip pedestrians in December , killing one and injuring at least 34 others from seven states , Mexico and Canada . -- Two bystanders were grazed by police gunfire in a January shooting during an evening musical fountain show at the Bellagio resort . The officer was firing at a man with a handgun , who was n't hit . -- A shooting in February killed two San Francisco Bay-area women and left a man wounded in a car after a fistfight in a Strip resort parking lot . -- A brazen takeover robbery at a warehouse-style liquor store stunned the city in April . Security video showed three assailants entering the store , and cameras recorded the shooting death of a 24-year-old clerk who police said did n't have the combination to open the safe . The headlines have prompted second-guessing amid the police rank-and-file -- including some who think dispersing gang detectives from a central office to the department 's eight regional commands was a bad idea . `` We did n't get more bodies . We moved people around , '' said Mark Chaparian , executive director of the local police union . `` When homicide numbers have doubled and violent crime is up , everyone looks at what happened and asks , ` What went wrong ? ' '' John Faulis , a lieutenant who heads the police supervisors ' union , agrees with Lombardo that Las Vegas police are understaffed . Department figures put the number of police officers in Las Vegas at 1.7 per 1,000 residents . The number is just under the 1.8 officers per 1,000 residents average for large cities in the West , according to FBI data , but below the average of 2.2 per 1,000 for similar-sized cities nationally . The ratio does n't count people staying in Las Vegas ' 150,000 hotel rooms . Lombardo , who looks to cities like Los Angeles , San Diego and Phoenix as models , said he believes half the homicides this year in Las Vegas have been associated with gangs . Police estimate that Las Vegas has 15,000 gang members . Los Angeles also is seeing a spike in crime this year compared with 2015 , said Kevin McCarthy , detective commander of a department with nearly 10,000 sworn police officers in a city of 4 million people -- a ratio of 4 per 1,000 . McCarthy said violent crime was up 16 percent and homicides were up 16.5 percent . In Phoenix , a city of 1.5 million people , homicides are up one-third this year , from 33 in the first four months of 2015 to 49 this year . The police department has a ratio of 2.1 officers per 1,000 residents . San Diego , a city of 1.4 million , appears to be an exception , with violent crime down 12 percent in the first three months of 2016 , compared with 2015 . It has 1.5 police officers per 1,000 residents . Elected officials in Las Vegas balked several times in recent years at proposals to hike the local sales tax to hire more officers before voting in September to increase the sales tax from 8.1 percent to 8.15 percent . `` Do we need more cops ? Obviously , '' said Steve Sisolak , chairman of the seven-member Clark County Commission , the elected body with oversight of the Las Vegas Strip . `` But how do you pay for them ?

Rajon Rondo gave the Lakers a huge lift off the bench , finishing with 17 points and 10 assists in 25 minutes . Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum each scored 30 points for Portland . The Lakers used a 16-0 run in the third quarter to take a 17-point lead . Josh Hart hit a 3-pointer with 9:44 left that gave the Lakers their biggest lead at 95-75 , forcing a Portland timeout . And the timeout might have been just what Portland needed to get back into the game . The Blazers went on a 22-8 run , cutting the Lakers ' lead to six points with 3:34 left after a layup by Jusuf Nurkic . Sloppy play once again came back to hurt the Lakers in the fourth quarter , but the Blazers could n't get much closer as James and JaVale McGee made crucial baskets in the final two minutes . Portland shot a 6 for 35 ( 17 percent ) from beyond the arc . The Lakers had seven turnovers in the fourth quarter and finished with 20 overall , but they survived their mistakes . The Lakers sped to a good start , but the Blazers quickly regained control . Turnovers and second chances fueled a 17-2 run by Portland in the first quarter . The Lakers bench helped get Los Angeles back into the game in the first half and outscored the Blazers subs 51-26 . TIP-INS Trail Blazers : Blazers head coach Terry Stotts says it 's hard to get a handle for where his team really is on the defensive end due to the league 's uptick in pace and scoring so far this season . `` It 's hard to get a handle around the league where defense is , '' Stotts said . `` The numbers say we 're 11th but it does n't feel like it , but we are . I think this season has to settle in to see where we are with it . Unless you hold a team to 80 or 90 you 'll always find things you have to get better at . '' Lakers : Phoenix Suns center Tyson Chandler will join the Lakers once he clears waivers after agreeing to a contract buyout . A person with direct knowledge of the situation confirmed the buyout plan to The Associated Press on Saturday , speaking on condition of anonymity because the Suns had not yet revealed it publicly . While Lakers head coach Luke Walton dodged direct questions about the move , Stotts likes what Chandler brings to the table for the Lakers .

'' teeple said that , so far this year , 38 students and 14 different teams have signed up for the collegiate competition , and that others are continuing to register . schools that will be represented include the university of michigan , macomb community college and washtenaw community college , in addition to hfcc , he said . individual collegiate competition will take place saturday , jan. 19 , and team competition sunday , jan. 20 , both in kellogg park . teeple said that since the festival 's early days , decorative ice carvings have expanded into functional pieces such as serving trays , punch bowls and `` shot luges .

By Barbara Boland \u2022 09/05/15 5:22 PM Syria has been torn apart since a civil war broke out in 2011 . The United Nations is investigating reports that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against his own people , and the Obama administration has long contended that Assad should step down . In 2013 , the administration proposed that the U.S. begin a bombing campaign against him , but a backlash in public opinion prevented the plan . It subsequently became clear that elements of the Islamic State were also involved in the rebellion against Assad . The U.S. has led a coalition of Arab states in airstrikes against Islamic State elements inside Syria since September 2014 . Putin has said that he was open to an `` international coalition '' to quash terrorists in Syria , but has said he is not impressed by U.S. efforts to date . `` We see what is going on -- the American [ air units ] are making airstrikes , '' Putin said , according to Russian state-owned media . `` It is premature to say that we are ready to do the same . '' Putin has also criticized the Obama administration 's fixation on removing Assad . `` People are running away not from [ Assad ] but from [ the ] Islamic State , '' Putin told Russian , state-owned RIA Novosti on Friday . He pointed out that the Islamic State is `` committing atrocities '' in `` large portions '' of Syria and Iraq .

How are they people supposed to live there ? Of course , they run away , '' Putin said . The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , a British-based monitoring group , said earlier this summer that the Islamic State controlled approximately half of Syria as of June . Putin also called for `` early parliamentary elections '' and `` establishing contacts with the so-called ` healthy ' opposition and involving them in governance , '' a proposal he said Assad agreed with . Kerry and Lavrov , the State Department said , `` agreed that discussions on the Syrian conflict would continue in New York later this month , '' when the General Assembly of the United Nations convenes on September 15 .

The U.S. Justice Department had wanted the trial to start in March , saying it needed more time to prepare for the complex case . The airlines said that such a long delay would threaten their merger . U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly said in court that March was `` too far off . '' The companies were close to completing a merger to create the world 's biggest airline , but the Justice Department and six states sued this month to block the deal . They said it would reduce competition and lead to higher prices for travelers . They said that the combined American-US Airways would be too dominant at Reagan National Airport outside Washington and on many routes around the country . While the hearing before Kollar-Kotelly was mainly procedural , attorneys for the two sides did manage to preview their key arguments . The two airlines argue that their merger would increase competition by creating another big competitor to United Airlines and Delta Air Lines , which grew through recent mergers . Richard Parker , an attorney representing US Airways Group Inc. , cited the presence of other competitors including Southwest , which carries more passengers within the United States than any airline . `` We will be talking to these airlines , '' Parker said . A review of other airlines ' documents and interviews of their executives will establish that competition in the industry is robust , he suggested . ? Copyright 2013 Associated Press .

South Korean President Moon Jae-in said Monday a thaw in relations between the two Koreas ahead of next month 's Winter Olympics presented a `` precious chance '' for the United States and North Korea to discuss the North ` s weapons programs . North Korea is developing missile and nuclear technology amid regular threats to destroy the United States and Japan and in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions . Han , addressing the UN-sponsored Conference on Disarmament , said nuclear tests last year had allowed his country to `` perfect a national nuclear force '' in a transparent manner . `` Thus DPRK ( North Korea ) at last came to possess a powerful and reliable war deterrent , '' he told the Geneva forum . `` I am proudly saying that DPRK 's nuclear force is capable of frustrating and countering any nuclear threats from the US and it constitutes a powerful deterrent that prevents the US from starting an adventurous war . '' Han said as a `` responsible nuclear power '' that North Korea could not resort to using the weapons unless hostile forces violate its sovereignty or interests . US disarmament ambassador Robert Wood said , `` The United States will not recognize North Korea as a nuclear weapon state . `` If the North wishes to return and be in the good graces of the international community , it knows what it has to do , it has to take steps toward denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula . '' In an earlier speech on Tuesday , United Nations disarmament official Izumi Nakamitsu welcomed an easing of tensions between North and South Korea , but called for further steps toward removing nuclear weapons from the divided peninsula .

Never miss a story get the latest viral news to your inbox Delivered To Your INBOX Never miss a story get the latest viral news to your inbox Email Address 0 May 14 , 2017 WWE News : Big Update On John Cena 's WWE Return Date , What Can Fans Expect When Cena Comes Back ? Lorenzo Tanos New reports suggest that John Cena 's WWE return date may have a patriotic twist to it , if you could call it that . With close to a month and a half having passed since his last appearance on WWE programming , it looks like the 16-time WWE Champion will be back on television on the Fourth of July , as he makes his return to SmackDown Live a few weeks prior to the blue brand 's Battleground pay-per-view . For a good part of 2016 and 2017 , Cena has been paying more attention to his Hollywood career , as he has been taking more and more time off from the WWE to shoot and/or promote movies . Earlier this week , The Wall made its debut , with Cena starring alongside Aaron Taylor-Johnson in a gritty war drama far removed from his usual comedic appearances in films such as Trainwreck and Daddy 's Home . Due to the filming of the latter movie 's sequel , Daddy 's Home 2 , wrestling fans are also having to wait a little longer for John Cena 's WWE return . But a report from Wrestling Inc. suggests that the decorated 40-year-old finally has a definite return date . With WWE heading to Phoenix right in time for the anniversary of America 's independence , John Cena is advertised for the July 4 episode of SmackDown Live . Wrestling Inc. noted that this is the only future date so far where Cena shows up on promotional materials , so there 's a chance this may be a one-off appearance before John continues focusing on non-wrestling-related projects . But with the SmackDown - exclusive pay-per-view Battleground scheduled for July 23 , there 's also a chance John Cena 's WWE return will see him engaging in a new rivalry to be showcased at that event . Playback : John Cena on ` The Wall , ' Favorite Films and Time Away From WWE https://t.co/Eg36VARlpT -- Variety ( @Variety ) May 11 , 2017 Prior to his current hiatus , Cena had last appeared at WrestleMania 33 , where , in a battle of real-life WWE `` power couples , '' he and Nikki Bella defeated The Miz and Maryse . Cena would successfully propose to Nikki after the match , though as the Inquisitr had previously reported , marriage plans for the newly-engaged couple are still `` very ground-level '' at the moment . What can we expect from John Cena when he makes his WWE return ? One possibility , regardless whether his July 4 SmackDown Live appearance in Phoenix is a one-off or the start of a full-fledged return , is his reappearance alongside Nikki Bella . As Nikki and her twin sister Brie are natives of nearby Scottsdale , it wo n't be surprising to see Nikki alongside her fianc\u00e9e as she makes her own return to WWE television . John Cena and fianc\u00e9e Nikki Bella were last seen by WWE fans at ` WrestleMania 33 . ' [ Image by WWE ] As for actual rivalries , Bleacher Report recently compiled a list of five possible wrestlers whom Cena could feud with once he comes back from his current hiatus . These include erstwhile mid-carders Baron Corbin and Dolph Ziggler , and the current number one contender for the WWE Championship , Jinder Mahal . But among those listed , the two highest-profile potential feuds for John Cena upon his WWE return may be those against United States Champion Kevin Owens and Shinsuke Nakamura . Talking about a possible Cena vs. Owens feud , Bleacher Report noted that this could be a chance for John to fight for the title he helped make relevant in 2015 , against no less than the man who defeated him in his very first WWE main roster match . The fact that Owens is currently hyping up his U.S. Championship by calling himself the `` Face of America '' was also brought up as a possible motivation for Cena , should he fight for that title . Shinsuke Nakamura vs. John Cena would be a rivalry between two heroic characters , and while Nakamura has yet to compete since being called up to the main roster on SmackDown Live , Bleacher Report observed that he is already one of the blue brand 's best-loved talents , and possibly in line to beat SmackDown 's finest as he moves up the card . Should both men face each other at some point in the future , Bleacher Report believes that it would make for a marquee match worthy of WWE 's biggest pay-per-view events . `` Nakamura vs. John Cena is a dream match waiting to happen , and there is bound to be electricity in the air when they inevitably share the same ring together . '' Who do you think John Cena should face when he makes his WWE return ? Do you think he 'll be placed back into SmackDown Live storylines for the brand 's Battleground PPV , or will his July 4 appearance be a one time deal for the time being ?

The comments came on a day in which Afghan forces took the lead from the US-led NATO coalition for security nationwide , marking a turning point for American and NATO military forces , which will now move entirely into a supporting role . It also opened the way for the full withdrawal of most foreign troops in 18 months After months of delays , the Taliban opened a political office in the Qatari capital of Doha , paving the way for talks to begin . The decision was a reversal of months of failed efforts to start peace talks while Taliban militants intensified a campaign targeting urban centres and government installations . In Doha , Taliban spokesman Mohammad Naim said the group opposes the use of Afghan soil to threaten other countries and supports the negotiating process , two key demands of both the US and Afghan governments before talks could begin . He made the statement shortly after the deputy foreign minister of Qatar said the Emir of the gulf state had given the go ahead for the office to open . Naim said the Taliban are willing to use all legal means to end what they called the occupation of Afghanistan . He thanked the leader of Qatar , Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani for allowing them to open the office . Obama administration officials said US representatives will begin bilateral meetings with the Taliban at the office in a few days , and Afghan President Hamid Karzai 's High Peace Council is expected to follow up with its own talks a few days later . Obama later called the opening of the Taliban political office an important first step toward reconciliation between the Taliban and Afghanistan 's government , although he said the Taliban still must denounce al-Qaida and predicted there will be bumps along the way . Obama , who spoke after meeting with French President Francois Hollande at the G-8 summit in Northern Ireland , also praised Karzai for taking a courageous step by sending representatives to Qatar to discuss peace with the Taliban . The administration officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record , vowed to continue to push the Taliban further and said that ultimately the Taliban must also break ties with al Qaida , end violence and accept Afghanistan 's constitution - including protections for women and minorities . Officials said that Obama was personally involved in working with Karzai to enable the opening of the office , and that US Secretary of State John Kerry had also played a major role . The US officials said the first meeting in Doha will focus on an exchange of agendas and consultations on next steps . The Taliban have for years refused to speak to the Afghan government or the Peace Council , set up by Karzai three years ago , because they considered them to be American `` puppets . '' Taliban representatives have instead talked to American and other Western officials in Doha and other places , mostly in Europe . Karzai also said he will soon send representatives from the High Peace Council to Qatar for talks but expressed hope the process would quickly move to Afghanistan - something US officials said was unlikely . `` We are hopeful that after starting negotiations in Qatar , immediately the negotiations and all the peace process should move into Afghanistan . Afghanistan should n't be centre of the discussions outside of the country , '' Karzai said . `` We do n't have any immediate preconditions for talks between the Afghan peace council and the Taliban , but we have principles laid down , '' Karzai said , adding that they include bringing an end to violence and the movement of talks to Afghanistan so they are not exploited by other countries . The US and its Western allies are trying to foster a peace process as foreign troops prepare to end their combat mission by the end of 2014 . The US-led NATO coalition formally handed over responsibility for nationwide security to Afghan security forces earlier Tuesday , with foreign troops moving entirely into a supporting role . The transition comes at a time when violence is at levels matching the worst in 12 years , fuelling some Afghans ' concerns that their forces are n't ready . The top US commander in Afghanistan , Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford , said the only way to end the war was through a political solution . `` My perspective has always been that this war is going to have to end with political reconciliation and so I frankly would be supportive of any positive movement in terms of reconciliation particularly an Afghan led and an Afghan owned process that would bring reconciliation between the afghan people and the Taliban in the context of the Afghan constitution , '' he said as reports were breaking that the Taliban were about to open an office . For US and other foreign combat troops on the ground , the transition means they will not be directly carrying the fight to the insurgency , but will provide training and mentoring , and back up as needed with air support and medical evacuations . NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the coalition will help militarily if and when needed but will no longer plan , execute or lead operations . `` This is a historic moment for our country and from tomorrow all of the security operations will be in the hands of the Afghan security forces , '' Karzai said at the ceremony , held at the new National Defence University built to train Afghanistan 's future military officers . Karzai said that in the coming months , coalition forces will gradually withdraw from Afghanistan 's provinces as the country 's security forces replace them . In announcing the fifth and final phase of a process that began at a November 2010 NATO summit in Lisbon , Portugal , Karzai said `` transition will be completed and Afghan security forces will lead and conduct all operations . '' Alliance training since 2009 dramatically increased the size of the Afghan National Security Forces , bringing them up from 40,000 men and women six years ago to about 352,000 today . Afghans will now have the lead for security in all 403 districts of Afghanistan 's 34 provinces .

The rural crime day of action , delivered in partnership with the National Farmers Union ( NFU ) and Countryside Watch , is being held today ( Wednesday November 25 ) across Cambridgeshire . Chief Inspector James Sutherland , event organiser , said : `` Parts of Cambridgeshire are very rural areas which can often be targeted by criminals . `` While we have seen the number of rural crime incidents in the county reduce by about a third in the past year , we have seen a spike in hare coursing , which will be our focus during the day of action . `` Our intention is to target offenders through mobile patrols and stop checks and deal with offences where they are found . This will be done using a combination of regular serving police officers , members of the Special Constabulary and partnership agencies . '' A tractor has kindly been loaned to the force free of charge for the event by horticultural machinery dealer , Ben Burgess , and will be branded with the full police Battenberg . Ch Insp Sutherland added : `` I would like to thank Ben Burgess for their generosity in loaning us one of their tractors as this will play a key part in helping us engage with members of the public and raise awareness of rural issues , including safe driving around tractors . `` As well as having officers out conducting anti-hare coursing and poaching patrols , officers will be highly visible driving the tractor across the county in a bid to educate drivers about safety when tractors are being driven on the road .

( FOX 8 Photo ) NEW ORLEANS ( WVUE ) - It 's been a month since the sheriff closed down a prisoner handling facility called `` the docks , '' prompting security concerns at Orleans Criminal Court . Now , a federal judge has ordered that the facility be reopened . Ever since the old parish prison closed , more than 200 inmates a day have brought to court by bus and offloaded in the sallyport . They are then escorted behind a makeshift fence into the old coroner 's office , then transferred through a court hallway and a courtroom in session . And they are closely guarded by sheriff 's deputies known at court as `` the men in black . '' `` Judges have told us they are concerned about security , '' said Simone Levine , with Court Watch Nola . Now , a federal judge has stepped in to say that the old docks facility in the rear of old parish prison must be reopened next week , in spite of staffing concerns expressed by the Sheriff 's Office . `` The judge has ordered that the city pay for the manpower we need in order to safely transport inmates through the old parish prison building and into court , '' said counsel for the Sheriff 's Office James Williams . `` At the end of the day , the city pays for everything . It 's a matter of doing it the right way , '' Mayor Mitch Landrieu said . Sources say securing the docks will require between 11 and 16 deputies . But they say it 's a much safer arrangement that wo n't inconvenience at least one judge whose court has been used as a prisoner walkway . The reopening of the docks is not considered to be the long-term solution , and the city is being required to explore other options . `` The sheriff does n't have the responsibility to build a replacement . The city has the responsibility to build that , '' Williams said . `` We 're not sure yet . We 're not finished our negotiations , '' Landrieu said . After testimony from New Orleans Police Chief Michael Harrison on Thursday , one issue that appears to be off the table is using New Orleans police officers to transfer inmates . `` Superintendent Harrison testified about his concerns of doing that , `` Williams said . But all sides are confident that a safer prisoner transport system will be in place next week . Landrieu questions how the construction of a new jail did not include a new facility to get inmates into and out of court . He says all of these issues are part of ongoing negotiations .

Post Your Comments | 1 Comments Seeking to dissuade labour unions from a nationwide strike on September 2 , the government today announced 42 percent minimum wage hike and a two-year bonus , but the trade bodies rejected these measures as `` completely inadequate '' and stuck to their call . Finance Minister Arun Jaitley , who heads an informal group of ministers constituted to address labour issues , said the minimum wages for unskilled non-agricultural workers will be hiked to Rs 350 per day from the current Rs 246 . Also , the government employees will be paid a wage bonus as per revised norms , for 2014-15 and 2015-16 , a move that will entail a payout of Rs 1,920 crore . Other ` labour-friendly ' moves included amendment in the Payment of Bonus Act and government support the cause of unions in high courts and the Supreme Court . The government also said that it will issue advisories to states for ensuring completion of trade union registration within 45 days . The trade unions , who are demanding minimum monthly wage of Rs 18,000 per month or Rs 692 a day and base pension of Rs 3,000 a month , were not impressed by the government 's move and said they would go ahead with the day-long general strike on Friday . The strike call is being supported by almost all major labour unions except RSS-affiliated BMS , and may impact banking and insurance services , power supplies and coal mining . `` The government 's minimum wage announcement is completely inadequate . The strike stands and we demand they should enact a law to fix minimum ( universal ) wage , '' All India Trade Union Congress General Secretary Gurudas Dasgupta said . `` Finance Minister 's statement clearly shows that the government has not considered any of the demands in our 12 - point charter .

Article Report an error FC Edmonton are proving to be for real and getting the rest of the North American Soccer League to take notice . Edmonton won their eighth-consecutive game at home Sunday , defeating the Carolina RailHawks 1-0 and are now perched at the top of the NASL Fall Season standings . They share top spot with the New York Cosmos , but have a game in hand on the defending league champions . `` This is n't a fluke . You do n't get to be where we are by playing poorly and not doing the right things , '' FC Edmonton head coach Colin Miller said . `` Sure , our goalkeeper has kept us in some games , but that 's his job . ( Sunday ) was a very workman-like professional performance with no panic and everyone committed to the cause . If we do that , we give ourselves a chance . '' Edmonton may have won the game against Carolina by just a goal , but the Eddies were vastly the superior team . They had 16 shot attempts on goal , eight hitting the target , to Carolina 's one shot on net . Had it not been for some lacklustre finishing and a few outstanding saves by RailHawks goalkeeper Brian Sylvestre , the game would have been a rout . The win came four days after FC Edmonton battled back from a goal down to defeat the Cosmos for the second time this year . `` It 's all ticking along nicely for the moment , '' Miller said . `` If you look at the players that we have coming into the starting eleven , it 's actually a very exciting group of players . `` We 're delighted with the attitude of the players and the substitutes that are coming in , who are really serving a purpose for us as well . They 're actually changing games for us . '' In his fourth year at the helm , Miller has assembled the best squad in FC Edmonton history . The team is built from defence out but also possess an enormous amount of skill in midfield allowing them to dictate play for long stretches . Against Carolina , it was one-way traffic from the 20th minute on as Edmonton methodically knocked the ball around waiting for an opening . In last Wednesday 's win over the Cosmos , they took advantage of a tired team and kept up the pressure until their opponents finally relented . `` We 're starting to be more united as a club , as a team and we know where certain players are going to be , '' said midfielder Dustin Corea . `` We 're playing with confidence and you see how well the guys are playing and we have different guys scoring goals . It 's a matter of patience and not worried about when the goals are going to come . '' Edmonton 's success is not limited to the Fall Season . They finished a point back of the Indy Eleven in the Spring Season title race . Despite missing out on an automatic playoff berth , Edmonton put themselves in good position to claim a post-season spot by virtue of a top-four combined record . Now , however , they are eyeing a Fall Season title and the automatic playoff berth associated with it . `` I do n't think our confidence can be much higher than it is right now , '' said striker Jake Keegan . `` Every time we go out , there 's a belief that we 're going to win , especially at home . `` When you have good defenders , a great goalkeeper and a team that is only going to give up , at most , one goal a game , you have the license to kind of be patient and be smart offensively . It 's a testament to the whole team that every game we win is 1-0 or 2-1 . It 's a combination of great work rate , defensive shape and organization . But there is also a lot of experience on the team and a lot of guys that know how to win . '' With 16 games left in the Fall Season , there is still a lot of soccer to be played , and Miller has brought in reinforcements to help Edmonton make a strong playoff push . This weekend , the club travels to face Puerto Rico FC before returning home to host Minnesota United FC . They 're looking to keep the ball rolling on the road with , at the very least , a tie in Puerto Rico . `` If you win every game at home and start getting draws away , then you 're going to be a playoff contending team , '' Keegan said . `` If you starting winning on the road , then you 're going to be a title-contending team .

Baltimore County Democratic Delegate John A. Olszewski Jr. says many of the workers who need sick leave the most , such as low-wage employees who ca n't afford to miss a day 's pay , are the ones who ca n't earn it in their jobs . More than 700,000 Maryland workers do n't have access to sick leave , Olszewski said Tuesday to the House Economic Matters Committee . Olszewski has introduced a bill requiring employees to give one hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked , capping the number at seven a year . In general , businesses that give other forms of paid time off would be exempt . The bill would apply to businesses with at least ten employees . Committee members heard horror stories Tuesday from restaurant cooks who have worked through severe illnesses . Mark Sine , a restaurant worker from Baltimore told the committee that he worked through a cold , which later progressed to mononucleosis , causing him to miss work for two weeks . `` If I had paid sick days , I would n't have had to feel this way . It would have given me a safety net , so I would n't have had to push myself so hard , and made myself even sicker , '' Sine told the committee . Matt Quinlan , a restaurant worker from Baltimore , also told the committee that in a number of the restaurants where he worked , if workers all had the flu , the cooks would place large buckets in the kitchen in case anyone got nauseous . ` If you 're physically ill , you can be sick , and we 'll share these buckets , do what you need to do , and then get back to work , '' Quinlan told the committee . Business owners and pro-business groups testified that the bill would hurt small employers and Maryland 's economic climate . Lobbyist Bruce Bereano , who testified on behalf of Safeway and a number of other businesses and associations read part of the bill aloud during his testimony , and criticized the measure as `` exceedingly broad '' in its scope . He noted that the sick leave is not just provided for workers to care for themselves or their immediate family members , but also their relatives . `` It is grossly unfair to employers . It presumes that they are wrong and that they are not fair to their employees and treating their employees correctly , '' Bereano added . The owner of a temporary employment agency in Timonium told the committee that many of the workers she places often miss work not because of illness , but because they must deal with government agencies that provide them with benefits such as transportation or child care assistance . Wanda Smith , president and CEO of Symphony Placements notes many of those government agencies are only open from 9-5 , which is often working hours for her employees . She suggested lawmakers order those agencies to expand their hours . `` Why ca n't we say that we will look at all of the social programs , and increase the hours , so that people do n't have to miss work , so they can stay gainfully employed , '' Smith told lawmakers . A Senate version of this bill will be the subject of a hearing on Thursday .

'' the court said the fact that citizens did not notice the data was being retained caused `` a vague and threatening sense of being watched . '' nearly 35,000 germans had appealed to the court to overturn the law , which stems from a 2006 european union anti-terrorism directive requiring telecommunications companies to retain phone data and internet logs for a minimum six months in case they are needed for criminal investigations . civil rights activists who had fiercely opposed the law welcomed the ruling . `` the government must not only refrain from collecting data , it must also protect citizens from the excessive gathering of information and building of profiles by the private sector , '' germany 's federal data protection watchdog , peter schaar , said in a statement . germans are sensitive to privacy issues , based on their experiences under the nazis as well as in the former east germany 's communist dictatorship . ignacio czeguhn , a professor with berlin 's free university , noted that while tuesday 's ruling was limited to the government it could have an impact on the private sector as well . `` this ( ruling ) raises the question , of course , what happens if a company does this ? '' he asked . security experts argue the information is crucial to being able to trace crimes involving heavy use of the internet , including tracking terror networks and child pornography rings . germany 's top security official , interior minister thomas de maiziere , expressed disappointment at the ruling and said the government would propose narrower legislation quickly . `` it would be inappropriate to criticize a ruling by the constitutional court , but i have to say that it does not instill happiness , '' he told reporters . justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , however , said it might take germany some time to revise the law . `` this is not the time to rush ahead on a national level , '' she said at a press conference . `` this is why i would not want to set a deadline now . '' the court ruled telecom data must not be stored in germany before there is a new law , and existing data must be erased . marc rotenberg , executive director of the washington-based electronic privacy information center , called the ruling a `` fairly narrow but very important decision '' that will primarily affect europe . he likened data retention to europe 's version of the patriot act , the u.s. law that gives authorities more investigative powers to combat terrorism . and there is `` clearly a rising tide '' against it in europe , he added . the ruling highlights tensions between the u.s. and europe when it comes to privacy standards , said eddan katz , international affairs director at the electronic frontier foundation . and it could to lead to the u.s. being unable to let similar legislation pass , he said , given that `` this was an experiment that was tried and as a matter of constitutional law rejected . '' other eu member states implementing the eu-wide directive have ordered even longer storage . britain requires internet service providers to store records of web and e-mail traffic _ though not their content _ for a year , but a government proposal there to set up a vast central database of phone and internet traffic met with strong opposition and was dropped . the netherlands also set 12 months for most data storage in a contentious decision , prompting the dutch digital rights group bits of freedom to applaud the german ruling . `` this is a groundbreaking ruling with big consequences for the netherlands , where the same mistakes have been made as in germany only to a larger degree , '' said spokesman axel arnbak . `` this ruling goes to show : protest pays . '' in sweden , where the eu directive has yet to be implemented , justice minister beatrice ask was quoted as saying the german ruling showed `` that we have been right in that that it concerns sensitive issues that demand very difficult judgments . '' in spain , telecom companies also have to retain data for whole year , but police are required to have a court order to access the data . that condition seems to have been enough to prevent any significant protests in a country with a long history of fighting violent basque separatism and more recently , islamic terror groups , said ruben sanchez , spokesman for the consumer rights federation called facua . the decision in germany , sanchez said , `` might serve as a wake-up call for governments not to overdo things .

Customer Support Venezuela 's PDVSA Says It Will Make April 12 Bond Payment by Company says it 's already started making coupon payments Odds of Venezuela nonpayment in 5 years are at 93 % : CDS prices Venezuela 's state oil producer PDVSA said it will pay $ 2.1 billion in bonds after a plunge in crude production and dwindling cash flow spurred bets on a default . Caracas-based Petroleos de Venezuela SA told investors that principal and interest payments related to its bond that matures this month will be available in investor accounts on April 12 , the company said in an emailed statement . It added that it had already started transferring coupon payments for other bonds that mature in 2027 and 2037 . The weeks leading up to the payment had seen volatile price swings in bond prices as investors worried a deteriorating political situation could influence the country 's ability or willingness to repay its debt . The country 's dollar bonds fell the most in two years on March 31 as an ongoing dispute between the government of President Nicolas Maduro and the opposition-controlled National Assembly worsened and resulted in street protests in Caracas . Those same bonds rallied the most in three months on Thursday after Caracas-based consultancy Ecoanalitica said in a report that PDVSA officials agreed to continue paying their debt obligations during a high-level meeting with counter-parties at the finance ministry and central bank . Both Maduro and his economy czar Ramon Lobo said ahead of the payment that the country would continue to honor its foreign debt obligations . `` Do you think we would have been better off in default ? , '' Maduro told a business group in Caracas on March 23 . `` Let 's think of the national interest , of our land . There continue to be insipid people who attack Venezuela from the inside and outside when we all must unite in a single effort to work .

Get our markets daily newsletter .

'' After making the April principal and coupon payments , the country is set to get a few months of breathing room , with the next big test set for October and November , when a total of $ 3.5 billion comes due . The long-term outlook continues to remain murky , with the odds of a credit event over the next five years at 93 percent , according to credit-default swaps data compiled by Bloomberg . The opposition-controlled Congress , meanwhile , has said that the country is unable to continue paying at current levels and should re-profile payment schedules . `` We have to propose a debt refinancing plan for the country because we can not repay this debt as it currently exists , '' opposition lawmaker Jose Guerra said on April 5 . `` We should n't go into a default but rather a new payment plan .

'' However , the 28-year-old says an interview he conducted in French has been mistranslated and taken out of context . `` Everybody has to know that I 'm happy here , '' said Pocognoli . `` OK , I 'm not playing , but I 'm quite happy with the other parts of my life here in West Brom and everything around West Brom . `` I do n't want to leave the club just to leave the club . It needs to be a good opportunity . `` For me , my ambition is to stay and play for West Brom , maybe next season . If not , then for sure , I need to play , so we will see . '' The 28-year-old , who joined from Hannover for & pound ; 1million in the summer of 2014 , still has a year left on his contract and has been attracting interest from Wolves . He has struggled to get minutes under Tony Pulis , and the Baggies boss openly admitted he was trying to move on both Pocognoli and Cristian Gamboa -- the club 's only recognised full-backs -- in January . Naturally , it 's a frustrating situation for the pair , but neither are believed to be rocking the boat . Insiders say both full-backs have handled their long periods of isolation professionally and with minimum of fuss . However , both were called into action last Wednesday during the FA Cup fourth round replay at Peterborough . Pocognoli came on for Gareth McAuley after 18 minutes and played centre-back for some of the match . `` It 's always good to get some minutes , '' said the Belgian . `` It 's not so much this season so I try to pick every minute that I can and try to do my best . `` It 's not easy because I need some matches to get to my best level but I try to help the team when they need me . `` It 's very hard to go there on the League One pitch against a very motivated team and more difficult when you 're brought off the bench . `` Central defence is not my position also , but I tried to do my best . '' What do you think ? Share your thoughts and join the discussion . Be the first to comment However , Pulis only played Gamboa and Pocognoli against Peterborough because his whole first-choice back four was out injured . It was the Belgian 's mix-up with Boaz Myhill that handed Posh one of their goals in the initial 2-2 draw at The Hawthorns . It 's highly likely that Pulis will try to move on both full-backs again this summer . `` We 've struggled at times at full-back and it 's an area we 've wanted to improve and bring people in since I 've come to the football club , '' said the Albion boss . `` We still have n't managed to do it .

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to officially inaugurate the power distribution programme tomorrow through a video conferencing session from Kurigram 's Dasiar Chhara , ending years of suffering faced by the areas ' residents . The distribution of the new power connections , however , began yesterday by bringing the former Bashkata enclave in Lalmonirhat 's Patgram upazila under the PDB 's services . Sheikh Mohammad Ala Uddin , chief engineer ( distribution ) for the PDB 's Rangpur region , launched the test operations of a power line capable of providing 250MW electricity . Ala Uddin said a total 2,000 electricity poles are needed to provide connection to all 59 former enclaves -- also known as Chhitmahals -- in Lalmonirhat 's Sadar , Hatibandha and Patgram upazilas . `` Funding for 1,000 poles has already been approved , and work has begun . Gradually , by next January , all families living in these areas would get power connections , '' he added . Syed Ali , 55 , a resident of Bashkata whose house got its first power connection yesterday , said : `` We have been freed from a confined life after 68 years . For the first time we are enjoying electricity -- the main component for a better life . `` Our children will finally be able to study under a light bulb , watch TV and use the internet .

The trailing hounds are trained to detect human scent and provide a direction of travel for teams to follow . Trailing hounds are a vital resource to law enforcement used to trail and apprehend escapees and fugitives . They have also proven to be an invaluable resource to the community to locate lost and missing persons . As the training progresses you may see Arizona Department of Corrections Officers in the community using the trailing hounds for this training exercise .

Will he or wo n't he ? With Cristiano Ronaldo currently struggling with a thigh injury , Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti has to decide whether to risk the fitness of his most important player in Wednesday 's Copa del Rey final against Barcelona . It would be a huge gamble on the part of the coach . The Portugal international is already considered touch-and-go for Madrid 's Champions League semifinal first-leg showdown , with reigning champion Bayern Munich at the Santiago Bernabeu on April 23 , because of the hamstring strain that saw him sit out the second leg of the last-eight tie against Borussia Dortmund . And , as that game at Signal Iduna Park so painfully illustrated , Madrid is just not the same side without the talismanic No. 7 . Of course , the night after Los Blancos ' lucky escape in Dortmund , Barcelona bowed out of the Champions League after losing 1-0 on the night , and 2-1 on aggregate , to Atletico Madrid . Unlike Ronaldo , Messi did start , but there were those who felt he may as well not have played , so negligible was his impact . Consequently , the question was once again raised : If you stop Messi , do you also by association stop Barcelona ? All of which begs another question : Is Madrid or Barcelona more reliant on its star player ? Who , essentially , is more important : Ronaldo or Messi ? Two of Goal 's writers go head to head over the issue ... HISTORY-MAKER RONALDO ALWAYS SCORES By Mark Doyle `` Given the chance , he will score . '' So said Diego Maradona of Cristiano Ronaldo during Euro 2012 . It is a simplistic statement . Yet its veracity can not be questioned . Cristiano Ronaldo always scores . The importance of the game is irrelevant . Since joining Real Madrid from Manchester United in 2009 , he has struck 246 times in 240 matches . He always finds the back of the net . In seemingly every game . Often more than once . And this without the same stellar supporting cast that Lionel Messi has behind him at Camp Nou . Indeed , as Fabio Cannavaro said last year , Ronaldo fully deserved to win the Ballon d'Or because he `` carries '' Real Madrid . And it 's no surprise . He is , as legendary United boss Sir Alex Ferguson says , `` the complete footballer . '' There is nothing he can not do . Particularly in Clasicos . Between January 2012 and October 2012 , Ronaldo faced Barcelona on six occasions . He scored seven times . Nobody in history has ever registered in six consecutive Clasicos . Not Ferenc Puskas . Not Alfredo di Stefano . Not Hugo Sanchez . Not Lionel Messi . Last week 's near-collapse at Signal Iduna Park perfectly illustrated just how reliant Real Madrid is on Ronaldo . Especially now . When the Portuguese was struggling with injury earlier this year , Jese Rodriguez was on hand to step in to Los Blancos ' attacking triumvirate . However , the youngster has now been ruled out for the season . Gareth Bale looks more effective in Ronaldo 's preferred position on the left wing but the Welshman has yet to prove himself in a Clasico . The same goes for Karim Benzema . Even in scoring twice against Barcelona last time out , the Frenchman still managed to show that in the big games he misses the big chances . Ronaldo does not . BARCA IS UNRECOGNIZABLE WITHOUT MESSI By Chris Myson When Lionel Messi is either absent from the squad or playing while short of full fitness , his Barcelona team is almost completely unrecognizable . The Argentine superstar , scorer of an astonishing 309 goals over the past six seasons , has led his side to four Ligas and two Champions League trophies since his first Ballon d'Or triumph in 2009 . He has consistently delivered in the biggest games , scoring decisive goals in both Champions League final victories against Manchester United . In the Clasico duels , he has been a constant thorn in Madrid 's side , scoring 15 times in 21 games since 2009 compared to Ronaldo 's 13 in the same number of matches . The Camp Nou star has nine assists compared to the Madrid talisman 's total of just one . At Madrid , an injured Ronaldo will always be missed but Los Blancos now have 100 million euro man Gareth Bale - enjoying a successful first season - to step in and fill at least some of the void . Karim Benzema , too , is enjoying his most effective campaign since arriving at the Bernabeu . Barca does not boast the same star power when Messi is not firing , despite the big-money move for Neymar last summer . The Brazilian is yet to find his best form at Camp Nou and despite his immense talent is years from being the finished product . The likes of Pedro and Alexis represent decent options , but usually Tata Martino is forced to deploy Cesc Fabregas or Andres Iniesta out of position whenever Messi is absent . The team is built around Messi and often it seems lost without him , playing with neither balance nor purpose . Last season 's Champions League semifinal against Bayern Munich perfectly illustrated this . An unfit Messi was completely ineffective in the first leg and unable to participate at all for the second . A toothless Barca was trounced 7-0 on aggregate .", "date": "2014-04-14 12:02:00", "url": "http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/88/spain/2014/04/14/4752255/which-clasico-superstar-would-be-missed-more-ronaldo-or", "phase": "D", "title": "Which Clasico superstar would be missed more -- Ronaldo or Messi ? - Goal.com", "names": [{"name": "cristiano ronaldo", "ids": ["Q11571"], "offsets": [[41, 43], [205, 206], [279, 280], [297, 298], [318, 320], [338, 340], [416, 417], [475, 476], [532, 533], [582, 583], [636, 637], [758, 759], [791, 792]]}, {"name": "carlo ancelotti", "ids": ["Q174614"], "offsets": [[53, 55]]}, {"name": "lionel messi", "ids": ["Q615"], "offsets": [[207, 208], [243, 244], [281, 282], [398, 400], [512, 514], [644, 645], [649, 651], [852, 853], [918, 919], [927, 928], [958, 959]]}, {"name": "mark doyle", "ids": ["Q47307481", "Q6767403"], "offsets": [[301, 303]]}, {"name": "diego maradona", "ids": ["Q17515"], "offsets": [[315, 317]]}, {"name": "fabio cannavaro", "ids": ["Q102027"], "offsets": [[410, 412]]}, {"name": "sir alex ferguson", "ids": ["Q44980"], "offsets": [[445, 448]]}, {"name": "ferenc puskas", "ids": ["Q1241665"], "offsets": [[499, 501]]}, {"name": "hugo sanchez", "ids": ["Q487155", "Q58171939"], "offsets": [[508, 510]]}, {"name": "gareth bale", "ids": ["Q184586"], "offsets": [[576, 578], [805, 807]]}, {"name": "karim benzema", "ids": ["Q1912"], "offsets": [[606, 608], [826, 828]]}, {"name": "cesc fabregas", "ids": ["Q17499"], "offsets": [[909, 911]]}, {"name": "andres iniesta", "ids": ["Q43729"], "offsets": [[912, 914]]}]}, {"articleID": "2012030714_00088996_W", "content": "few people deny fort wayne 's urgent need to make progress toward replacing its aging network of water mains , which in recent years have started breaking down at a record pace . but not everyone agrees on how to pay for it , or that city council did the right thing by approving a 40 percent hike to fort wayne water rates , which will phase in over the next three years . most council members expressed concern over the city 's initial plan , which would have phased in the hike over two years , and asked fort wayne city utilities officials to come up with ways to lessen the impact to ratepayers . but in the end , council succeeded only in getting city utilities to stretch the increase - which still must get approval from the indiana utility regulatory commission - over an extra year , barely dulling the short-term impact . `` i think they really punted it , '' said john kalb , a resident who spoke out against the rate hike during a council meeting last week . `` i think they should have sent the whole thing back to the administration and said ` you have other means to pay for this . ' '' by `` other means , '' kalb was referring to roughly $ 75 million available to the city through the lease and sale of its old electric utility to indiana michigan power . the `` legacy '' fund is comprised of a $ 36 million trust , built up over decades through lease payments from i & m , and a $ 39.2 million settlement for the old utility 's remaining assets . costly infrastructure neither kalb nor almost anyone else seems to dispute the poor condition of fort wayne 's water utility infrastructure or the need for more money to fix it . after lengthy discussions on the issue , council voted 7-2 in favor of the rate increase , and even the two who opposed it - councilmen russ jehl , r-2nd , and mitch harper , r-4th - said they understood the need to update the city 's water mains more quickly . the need for more revenue is largely driven by the deterioration of fort wayne 's cast-iron water mains , a problem that has ramped up at an alarming rate in recent years , and higher daily operating costs for city utilities . over the last two years , city utilities workers have had to fix an average of 450 main breaks annually , with each of the repairs costing about $ 5,600 . that means the department is spending about $ 2.5 million each year just to keep up with the breaks , city utilities spokeswoman mary jane slaton said . at the same time , higher costs for fuel , chemicals and other needs , combined with lower water usage by ratepayers , have left too little money to make headway against the problem . `` after our debt service and operating costs , we have almost nothing left for capital improvements , '' jehl said during tuesday 's council meeting . the city 's worst water mains date back at least half a century and are made of cast iron , which has a much poorer life span than the durable plastic materials that are used today . for decades , city officials did n't know how badly the pipes would deteriorate and neglected to replace aging mains , city utilities officials have said . it would now cost $ 615 million to replace all the water mains that have fallen into poor condition , city utilities director kumar menon said in an email . once it takes full effect in 2015 , the three-year rate increase passed by council will provide enough extra revenue to increase the department 's annual water-main replacements from six miles to nine , officials have said . even at the increased rate , it will take more than 100 years to catch up to the problem . in addition , about $ 8 million of a ratepayer-funded $ 40 million bond , which council preliminarily approved tuesday , will go toward 16 miles of annual replacements until the new rates take full effect . no time to explore legacy funding though kalb does n't dispute the need for more money to replace the old water mains , he contends the city should have looked first to its $ 75 million legacy fund before raising rates or taking on more debt . and council should have forced the administration to give the idea a closer look , he said . council president tom smith , r-1st , said in a recent interview that he would have been open to the idea , but that city officials did not leave council enough time to explore the idea before approving the rate hike . `` i do n't think it really occurred to us that ( legacy fund ) should go toward city utilities because that 's ratepayer funded , '' he said . `` that 's really a public policy discussion . should we take legacy money and use it for city utilities or not ? '' city officials urged council to pass the rate hike as quickly as possible so the increase could be taken to the indiana utility regulatory commission for approval , a process that could take at least nine months . menon also said the city needed to set the new rates as soon as possible so it could refinance about $ 17 million in debt for its 2008 takeover of aqua indiana 's north-end customers and assets . though menon said short-term cash infusions are not a sustainable way to fund the utility operations , he said he would welcome legacy funds as a way to pay for improvements if the money became available . `` if we have the opportunity to use some of the legacy fund in the future , city utilities would try to take advantage of that opportunity , '' he said . however , mayor tom henry has publicly opposed using the $ 75 million fund to offset property taxes or pay down debt , so it seems unlikely he would support tapping the money to avoid utility rate hikes . henry has created three teams to come up with suggestions on how to best spend the money and expects them to report back to him this spring . but the mayor and council have the final authority to spend the funds , and henry has said he would favor bold initiatives . smith , meanwhile , said the debate on rate increases for city utilities and the need to address the city 's glaring infrastructure needs could steer decisions on the money - possibly in a more conservative direction - once the republican-controlled council has a say in the matter . `` we 're going to push for some of that money being used for true needs and not just discretionary spending , '' he said .", "date": "2012-03-07 14:39:03", "url": "http://news-sentinel.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120307/NEWS/120309665/1054", "phase": "C", "title": "water hike raises questions about legacy funds - news-sentinel . com", "names": [{"name": "john kalb", "ids": ["Q55805083"], "offsets": [[166, 168], [219, 220], [289, 290], [728, 729]]}, {"name": "mitch harper", "ids": ["Q6880888"], "offsets": [[349, 351]]}, {"name": "mary jane", "ids": ["Q16056069", "Q56878198", "Q7145596"], "offsets": [[465, 467]]}, {"name": "tom smith", "ids": ["Q16981003", "Q19667452", "Q19972580", "Q20710827", "Q23664645", "Q2440114", "Q24844308", "Q27448078", "Q276620", "Q3530889", "Q39426457", "Q45193738", "Q52907046", "Q58207646", "Q58427805", "Q7817616", "Q7817618", "Q7817619", "Q7817620", "Q7817621", "Q7817627", "Q7817630", "Q7817632"], "offsets": [[788, 790], [1118, 1119]]}, {"name": "mayor tom", "ids": ["Q19698223"], "offsets": [[1029, 1031], [1096, 1097]]}]}, {"articleID": "2010021218_00140656_W", "content": "` green bridge ' path of cotton pests feb 12 , 2010 11:13 am , by ron smith , farm press editorial staff burning down the green bridge that gives insect pests a path to move from winter hosts to cotton plants may reduce in-season insecticide sprayings significantly and could protect seedling cotton from early damage , says an arkansas state university extension entomologist . scott stewart told a group of cotton consultants during the recent beltwide cotton conferences in new orleans that timing preplant burndown weed control is critical to minimize early season insect problems . `` controlling weeds in areas around the field and along ditch banks is also critical , '' he said during the annual cotton consultant 's conference segment of the beltwide . `` such pests as the tarnished plant bug have a huge host range , '' stewart said . `` hosts include henbit and just about every cotton field has henbit . spider mites also like henbit and that weed can be a part of the green bridge . '' stewart said the green bridge is vegetation that harbors insect pests that move into cotton . `` we 've seen a lot of changes in cotton insect control over the past few years , '' he said . `` bt cotton , the boll weevil eradication program and crop rotation have changed the way we manage pests . '' he said rotation to other crops , such as corn , may provide alternative hosts for sucking bugs and other insect pests . no-till and reduced-till systems also affect pest survival . `` a lot of areas have to use reduced-till to improve conservation , improve production and boost the bottom line , but farmers need to be aware of the effect on insects . '' he said some pests thrive in reduced-till systems . cutworms , slugs , false chinch bugs and aphids , among others , may find favorable conditions in reduced-till fields . `` a good burndown herbicide helps remove the green bridge that allows cutworms to move from one host to another , '' he said . slug problems `` may be exclusive to no-till . false chinch bugs can also cause problems . late weed control is a factor '' in pest survival . stewart said thrips numbers may be reduced in no-till systems because of the cooler soil temperatures . but under the right conditions he said farmers can `` get a double whammy with thrips and diseases . '' he said aphids can be more numerous in no-till situations , along with fire ants . plant bugs and spider mites also may be present in higher numbers in no-till or reduced-till systems . stewart said control measures in the mid-south may include `` area-wide plant bug management . if we treat ditch banks early enough , along with in-field burndown applications , we can reduce in-season plant bug treatments . this approach will not fit all farms , especially those with small fields scattered over several miles . '' concentrations of crp acreage also make this approach more difficult . he said the economic effect of a timely burndown herbicide application may include one or two fewer in-season plant bug treatments . `` farmers could save almost $ 6 per acre . we 're trying to make growers aware of the need for timely burndown herbicide applications . '' he said controlling all broadleaf weeds at least 21 days before planting is the goal . `` to do that , we need to apply a burndown herbicide four to six weeks earlier . also , pests are mobile so we have to do outside-the-field management and be aware of pest movements . this course covers a wide range of options to effectively control weeds in cotton and reduce the risk of weed resistance management . it is accredited for hours/units for licensed/accredited applicators in 7 u.s. cotton belt states ( florida , georgia , new mexico , oklahoma , texas , south carolina an d tennessee . cca credit is pending ) . this course is accredited in texas , oklahoma , new mexico , virginia , west virginia and wyoming as well as for cca credits", "date": "2010-02-12 18:31:48", "url": "http://deltafarmpress.com/cotton/cotton-pests-0215", "phase": "A", "title": "` green bridge ' path of cotton pests", "names": [{"name": "ron smith", "ids": ["Q15429434", "Q16151519", "Q16214918", "Q20640642", "Q20732311", "Q21598352", "Q28455021", "Q30069157", "Q3441453", "Q7364400", "Q7364401", "Q7364402", "Q7364403", "Q7364404", "Q7364405", "Q7364406", "Q7364407", "Q7364409"], "offsets": [[16, 18]]}, {"name": "scott stewart", "ids": ["Q19519202", "Q3297647", "Q3476314", "Q7437317"], "offsets": [[65, 67], [143, 144], [177, 178], [385, 386], [456, 457]]}]}, {"articleID": "2010101114_00368882_W", "content": "eliminate vendor lock-in with next-generation virtualization management building the cloud blueprint for enterprise it continuous business transformation : the cloud value chain microsoft 's cloud services approach defining enterprise-class cloud computing : managed cloud services deploy an enterprise private cloud in less than 30 days with surgient parting the clouds - evaluating clouds and cloud providers for the enterprise the cloud 's not the revolution : cloud usage is storm clouds - disruptive technologies creating the `` new normal '' the enterprise private cloud - from infrastructure to applications a new generation of secure cloud computing solutions key challenges in cloud computing and how yahoo ! is approaching them understanding the relationship between workloads and the cloud does enterprise-class cloud storage really exist ? unleashing the economic benefits of cloud computing enterprise-level cloud computing : far-off dream or present reality ? from the wires green mountain power named finalist for international environmental award colchester , vt -- ( marketwire ) -- 10/11/10 -- green mountain power has been named a finalist in the platts 2010 global energy awards . the competition is intended to honor and recognize those that have transcended the status quo in the name of excellence in leadership , innovation and performance . green mountain power has been recognized in the `` green energy initiative '' category . `` we are honored to receive this recognition , '' says mary powell , president and ceo of green mountain power . `` green mountain power is committed to an energy vision that builds environmental and economic value for our customers , while helping to create a clean energy economy that combats climate change and creates green jobs in vermont . this nomination recognizes some of the steps we have taken to build utility-owned renewable generation projects and to promote customer-owned solar .

'' commenting on the housing needs of the eastern province , jenan 's md and ceo bassam boodai , said : `` it is expected that the eastern province will require around 150,000 housing units by 2014 , which is the highest demand in the kingdom . '' looking at the overall picture he went on to say : `` according to the central department of statistics and information , saudi arabia 's population is growing at a rate of 3.2 percent and with about 60 percent of saudi population under the age of 30 the private and public sector needs to take serious action to cater for the ever increasing demand . the government has already taken decisive action to tackle the problem by injecting sr 250 billion into affordable housing and now it 's up to the private sector to accommodate the demand . a collaboration between the private sector and the government will be the most effective approach to meet the increasing demand in a record time . '' saudi arabia has traditionally been a country where home construction or purchase was self-financed , with family and personal savings being the major driver of property financing . this is starting to change as progress is being made in mortgage financing and new regulations for off-plan financing . bank financing is still relatively limited and out of reach for a significant proportion of the population . real estate and construction loans accounted for 7.1 percent of total bank credit in 2010 while home loans were only 2.8 percent of total bank credits . this is very low in comparison to other gcc countries . `` the kingdom 's real estate sector is now maturing as it begins to fulfill the high expectations of investors . the cityscapeconnect business breakfasts serve as a prelude to the annual cityscape jeddah event in june 2012 with its unique portfolio of exhibition and summits which is in line with the government 's vision for growth in the real estate industry , '' said deep marwaha , group director of cityscape . `` in addition to affordability in the residential market , the business breakfasts will cover the need for innovative financing models to secure the funds for project development in the current climate , profitability structures for public-private partnership models , and the cost of land for developing affordable housing projects in attractive locations .

The 56-year-old was involved in some high-profile outbursts during his time in charge of Leicester . Here , the PA news agency looks at examples of Premier League managers losing their tempers . Nigel Pearson ( Leicester ) Nigel Pearson was sacked by Leicester in June 2015 ( Lynne Cameron/PA ) In April 2015 , the then-Leicester manager bizarrely branded a journalist `` an ostrich '' , `` stupid '' and `` daft '' after taking exception to a question about his struggling players receiving criticism . Pearson , who earlier that season controversially grabbed Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur around the throat , spent almost two minutes responding and then walked out of the post-match press conference which followed a 3-1 home defeat to Chelsea . Alan Pardew ( Newcastle ) Alan Pardew , right , headbutted David Meyler , left , in 2014 ( Lynne Cameron/PA ) Pardew received a three-match stadium ban followed by a four-game touchline ban after an astonishing headbutt on Hull 's David Meyler in March 2014 . The flashpoint occurred after midfielder Meyler pushed the Newcastle boss as he attempted to retrieve the ball for a throw-in . Pardew , whose side won 4-1 at the KC Stadium , was also fined \u00a3 100,000 by his club and \u00a3 60,000 by the Football Association . Louis Van Gaal ( Manchester United ) Louis Van Gaal made headlines with a theatrical fall ( Martin Rickett/PA ) The experienced Dutchman theatrically threw himself to the ground in front of fourth official Mike Dean after becoming frustrated at a perceived dive from Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez in March 2016 . Van Gaal , who drew cheers from many United fans at Old Trafford , later apologised to referee Craig Pawson for his comical behaviour and admitted emotion had got the better of him . Harry Redknapp ( Portsmouth ) Harry Redknapp was angered by one of his players during a Portsmouth training session ( Chris Ison/PA ) An unknown Portsmouth player prompted the wrath of his manager by kicking a ball at him as he was conducting a training ground interview . Despite attempting to continue the conversation , Redknapp 's mind was clearly elsewhere . The incident provoked an angry rant and some colourful language , including : `` You tried to kick it in the goal and you hit me ? No wonder he 's in the f ****** reserves . '' Jose Mourinho ( Manchester United ) Jose Mourinho , left , reacted angrily to reporters following a loss to Mauricio Pochettino 's Tottenham ( Nick Potts/PA ) In August 2018 , the Portuguese stormed out of a press conference demanding more respect after being involved in an angry exchange with reporters . The incident followed United 's 3-0 home defeat by Tottenham . Mourinho held three fingers up to journalists , referring to the number of Premier League titles he had lifted , while pointing out that he had `` won more Premierships alone than the other 19 managers together '' . Maurizio Sarri ( Chelsea ) Maurizio Sarri , left , was unhappy after goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga refused to be substituted ( Nick Potts/PA ) Former Chelsea boss Sarri has form for losing his cool . During February 's Carabao Cup final against Manchester City , the Italian headed for the Wembley tunnel in a rage after goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga defied orders and refused to be substituted for Willy Caballero before the game went to penalties . The Blues lost the shoot-out but Sarri was quick to dismiss the controversy as a `` misunderstanding '' . He then appeared to storm out of training on the eve of the Blues ' Europa League final against Arsenal , throwing his baseball cap to the ground and kicking it before walking down the Baku Olympic Stadium tunnel . 0 comment", "date": "2019-12-06 20:21:28", "url": "http://www.herefordtimes.com/sport/national/18086104.premier-league-managers-lose-cool/", "phase": "E", "title": "When Premier League managers lose their cool", "names": [{"name": "nigel pearson", "ids": ["Q154126"], "offsets": [[11, 13], [27, 29], [82, 84], [87, 89], [136, 137]]}, {"name": "james mcarthur", "ids": ["Q1256895"], "offsets": [[147, 149]]}, {"name": "alan pardew", "ids": ["Q360491"], "offsets": [[176, 178], [181, 183], [198, 199], [244, 245]]}, {"name": "david meyler", "ids": ["Q126332"], "offsets": [[187, 189], [217, 219], [228, 229]]}, {"name": "louis van gaal", "ids": ["Q207431"], "offsets": [[271, 274], [278, 281], [323, 325]]}, {"name": "mike dean", "ids": ["Q3857378", "Q6846533", "Q794992"], "offsets": [[305, 307]]}, {"name": "alexis sanchez", "ids": ["Q180553"], "offsets": [[317, 319]]}, {"name": "craig pawson", "ids": ["Q16734311"], "offsets": [[341, 343]]}, {"name": "harry redknapp", "ids": ["Q221349"], "offsets": [[357, 359], [362, 364], [412, 413]]}, {"name": "jose mourinho", "ids": ["Q79983"], "offsets": [[457, 459], [463, 465], [520, 521]]}, {"name": "mauricio pochettino", "ids": ["Q313000"], "offsets": [[476, 478]]}, {"name": "maurizio sarri", "ids": ["Q3852721"], "offsets": [[559, 561], [564, 566], [586, 587], [641, 642]]}, {"name": "kepa arrizabalaga", "ids": ["Q3195361"], "offsets": [[573, 575], [616, 618]]}, {"name": "willy caballero", "ids": ["Q441986"], "offsets": [[626, 628]]}]}, {"articleID": "2014042814_00043225_W", "content": "Sydney ( AFP ) - Australia on Monday said it would intensify the underwater hunt for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 as it conducts as thorough a search as `` humanely possible '' . `` If necessary , of the entire probable impact zone which is roughly 700 kilometres by 80 kilometres , '' Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters , when asked about the size of the search area .

Minneapolis ' top prosecutor , Mike Freeman , confirmed he needed more time to conclude his investigation , raising fears the probe has been bungled . Mr Freeman said four months ago he expected to decide by the end of 2017 if Officer Mohamed Noor would be charged for Ms Damond 's death , but he is now unable to give Ms Damond 's Sydney-based family a timetable for when they will receive the answers they crave . `` A dedicated team in the Hennepin County Attorney 's Office has been working diligently since we received the case in mid-September , '' Mr Freeman said in a statement . `` Our goal was to complete the review and make a decision on whether or not to bring charges by the end of the year . `` We are getting more information and evidence and additional investigation must be completed . `` As I have mentioned before , the investigation and review of the case will not be rushed . It is more important to get it right than to get it done quickly . '' Mr Freeman said he contacted Ms Damond 's family by phone and `` expressed the deepest sympathies from himself and the Hennepin County Attorney 's Office and explained why there would be no decision by December 31 '' . Officer Noor 's lawyer blasted Mr Freeman and said `` recent developments do give us pause '' . `` I am concerned by the statement 's suggestion Mr Freeman has taken the investigation in-house , '' Officer Noor 's lawyer , Thomas Plunkett , said . `` Objectivity and integrity are the keys to ` get it right ' .

He could have been any other reporter standing outside the Rochester civic center on Thursday , awaiting President Donald Trump 's rally . At least , so it seemed in that particular shot . `` I 've met people all the way from Mankato , from Iowa , from Eagle Lake , you name it , '' Bunner said in his NBC news station 's Facebook Live feed . `` They are excited for the fact the president of the United States is visiting Rochester . This is big ! This ` yuge , ' in the words of Donald Trump .

Na was pumping his fist after every putt down the stretch at the TPC Summerlin , which yielded six scores of 63 or better . Na , who lives in Las Vegas and won the 2011 event for his first PGA Tour title , set the tournament 's 54-hole record at 22-under 191 . Cantlay was staying with him until he failed to get up-and-down from a bunker on the reachable par-4 15th and made bogey from the bunker on the par-3 17th . He closed with a 15-foot birdie putt for a 63 . Cantlay won the tournament two years ago and was runner-up last year . Pat Perez had a 62 and was four shots behind . Sam Ryder ( 64 ) and Lucas Glover ( 66 ) were another shot back . Conditions were warm and calm , ideal for scoring and it showed . Tony Finau had a 62 to take the lead as the final groups were teeing off . He finished the day seven shots behind . Denny McCarthy and Luke List each posted 63 . `` It 's hard to look at some of those numbers when you have n't even teed off -- you see 8s and 9s ( under ) out there -- and not play impatient , '' Ryder said after a bogey on the 18th for his 64 . Na and Cantlay came out firing . Na has been doing his damage on the greens . In each of the last two grounds , he has gained an average of about 5.5 strokes on the field in putting and leads the tournament in that key statistical category . He does n't see any change for Sunday , when he goes for his second victory of the year . Na won in Colonial in May . `` Still got to keep the pedal to the metal . Anyone can shoot 8 or 9 under , '' Na said . `` I believe we 're going to get a little more wind tomorrow . Got to go out and post a good number . '' Na also shot 61 in the 2010 Wyndham Championship and at Colonial in 2018 . He posted this number even with a par on the 16th hole , the par 5 over water that played as the easiest on the TPC Summerlin . His tee shot was blocked by a tree and he had to lay up short of the water , but he hit wedge to a tight pin on the front of the green to about 4 feet . Cantlay had six birdies on the tougher front nine -- none longer than the 8-foot range , three of them tap-ins -- for the lead . Na played in the group ahead , made birdie on the 10th to tie and then pulled away in the final hour . Na drove to the back of the 15th green and converted the long two-putt birdie from just off the green with a 6-footer . Cantlay put it in the right bunker and missed his 8-foot birdie putt . That was the separation Na needed , and he stretched it with a pair of closing birdies . The average score was 67.75 . Low scores were n't available to just anyone . Phil Mickelson started the third round just four shots behind and was 5 over through 11 holes . He rallied with a few birdies to salvage a 74 .

They have previously performed a jive , as well as the more sensual tango and paso doble routines . Comedian Walsh and Jones , who is married to Strictly dancer Neil Jones , have both apologised for making a mistake after being pictured in The Sun kissing on a night out . Walsh has since been publicly dumped by his girlfriend Rebecca Humphries , who has received support from celebrities including Stacey Solomon and Carol Vorderman . Humphries , a theatre and TV actress , had said in a statement on Twitter that she was `` not a victim '' , thanking people for their support and revealing that the pictures were taken last week on her birthday while she was home alone . She said that `` his actions over the last three weeks had led to believe something inappropriate was going on '' , and that he denied it , repeatedly calling her `` psycho/nuts/mental '' . Humphries , who had been in the audience last weekend to support Walsh and Jones , added : `` But -- this whole business has served to remind me that I am a strong , capable person who is now free ; and no victim . `` I have a voice and will use it by saying this to any woman out there who deep down feels worthless and trapped with a man they love : `` Believe in yourself and your instincts . It 's more than lying . It 's controlling .

( @Cymru ) June 8 , 2019 The youthful nature of Giggs ' side was reflected by the fact that six of the starting XI have made their international bows since the Manchester United great was appointed Wales manager 17 months ago . `` This is their first real taste of international football , '' Tottenham defender Davies , one of the few survivors from Wales ' Euro 2016 squad to start in Osijek on Saturday , said of the young players in Giggs ' squad . `` But we have n't really got too much time for that learning curve if we want to qualify for the Euros . `` Sometimes it does n't matter how you win games .

Brown , who is originally from Shamong , N.J. and moved to Yardley , Pa. with her family when she started high school at Pennington School , was in line to take a kick but did n't need to take a spot kick in the end . A save by goalkeeper Olivia Barnhill in the fifth round ended the game and made Brown a Division III national champion for the third time . `` That moment was pretty surreal , I pretty much just broke down in tears , just so happy and overwhelmed , '' she said . `` When I saw my family in the stands I got even more emotional , they 've been the rocks throughout my career . '' Lauren Brown ( middle ) with her brother and sister both dressed in cow suits ( the Ephs mascot is a purple cow ) after winning her third national title with Williams College . Brown was a reserve midfielder her first season , making only five appearances during the first national title run , but became a regular her sophomore season when the team lost in the national final to Messiah and played every game of her junior and senior seasons . The only other losses during her time in Massachusetts all came against Middlebury , including a 1-0 loss in the conference championship in November . `` Being able to play Middlebury in the final was a big send off , '' she said . Some key injuries threatened to derail the team 's journey back to the final this year , but that was where the experience of Brown and her six classmates came into play , leading the team back to the pinnacle of college soccer . The senior class ended their time at Williams with an 80-4-9 record . `` This year was pretty much the best and most difficult year of my career , '' Brown said . `` Difficult in that we had plenty of injuries and because of that had to change up our lineup a lot and deal with some small dynamic issues because of that . There were really just problem solving pieces along the whole way and I definitely at times thought ` wow , it 's going to take a lot for us to get back there . '' ' The lone player from the Philadelphia area on the squad , Brown 's soccer journey is one with deep ties on both sides of the Delaware River . She started out playing for Indian Mills Soccer Club in New Jersey with her dad , Ken Brown , as one of her coaches and later played for Millville SC and FC Bucks while also participating in the New Jersey Olympic Development Program . She starred at Pennington School in high school , where she was on teams that won three state championships . She credits her dad , who played at Lehigh University in the early ` 90s , with passing on his love of the game and her whole family for the many sacrifices made and the long hours commuting to training -- about 90 minutes to training with FC Bucks twice a week and games on weekends when they still lived in Shamong . `` He tried having a soccer ball at our feet when we were young , '' Brown said of her dad . `` But both my parents and my entire family have been so supportive ; they watch every one of my games , are the first to text me or call me after each game and my dad and siblings were able to come down to UNCG for the final four , which was an amazing experience . '' Ken Brown experienced a wide range of emotions himself the night of the final . `` The range of emotions was unbelievable , from sadness knowing her career was coming to a end , to nervousness over her last collegiate game coming down to PKs for a national championship , to complete joy that I got to experience such a wonderful ride from an amazing career , '' Ken Brown said . He was also relieved because of some nagging injuries his daughter has dealt with over her time in college . `` For the last four years ( she ) has endured a blood circulatory issue , tendonitis in both Achilles and shin splints , '' he said . `` Lu had to rehab before every practice and game for her entire collegiate career so she could play for her coach and teammates at Williams . '' She already has a job as a quantitative data analyst lined up in Boston when she graduates in May so with soccer over now her focus has shifted to finishing out her final semester . Looking back on her successful playing career that ended the way so many players can only dream , she said she 'll have way more than just the three national titles to cherish . `` Even beyond all this success there 's these lifelong relationships I 've been able to cultivate , '' she said . `` I 'm really just so so thankful but also sad that I ca n't be on this journey anymore with this second family I 've been able to have here at Williams .

And while his showdown with Brooklyn 's Elton Dharry in Melbourne has been overshadowed by the code-war on the same card between AFL great Barry Hall and rugby league slugger , Paul Gallen , Moloney has not lost focus on realising a dream that started 17 years ago . Moloney kept chasing a boxing career despite losing his first seven amateur fights and he carries that determination into the biggest fight of his life . The 28-year-old is the No. 1 contender for the world super-flyweight ( 52.5 kg ) title and is unbeaten in 20 pro fights including a stoppage over Panama 's former world champ Luis Concepcion and Chile 's red-hot Miguel Gonzalez .

Twin brother Jason Moloney , who went within a whisker of winning the world bantamweight title last year in Florida , will fight Nicaragua 's world No. 10 Dixon Flores on the same card and is expected to challenge for another world title next February . The brothers have been slugging away in training at their Cudgen base in northern NSW beside Hall as he prepares to make his mark in his pro debut against one of the hardest punchers in the country . Andrew Moloney celebrates winning against Selmani Bangaiza at the Seagulls Club at Tweed Heads on June 15 .

Subban ( 76 ) leaps as he congratulates teammate Max Pacioretty ( 67 ) on his goal against Boston Bruins goalie Tuukka Rask during the second period in Game 7 of a second-round NHL hockey Stanley Cup playoff series in Boston , May 14 , 2014 . THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Max Pacioretty scored the winner midway through the second period and Carey Price stopped 29 shots as the upstart Montreal Canadiens defeated Boston 3-1 in Game 7 on Wednesday to oust the league-leading Bruins from the playoffs . The Canadiens started fast and then stymied the Bruins , winners of the Presidents ' Trophy for the best regular-season record , to advance to the Eastern Conference final against the New York Rangers . Dale Weise and Daniel Briere , with a late power-play goal , also scored for Montreal . Jarome Iginla 's goal , which cut the Canadiens ' lead to 2-1 with 2:08 remaining in the second , set the scene for a dramatic third period . The black and gold faithful hoped for yet another Bruins comeback . They almost got their wish early in the third when Iginla , pouncing on a rare Price rebound , hit the post . Boston came on but the Canadiens held fast and Price , improving his record in elimination games in 2014 to 5-0 including the Olympics , was rock-solid with a disciplined team defending in front of him . The late Boston surge was not helped by a Johnny Boychuk penalty for interference with 4:31 remaining . Montreal scored on the ensuing power play when Briere 's centring pass bounced in off Zdeno Chara 's skate at 18:07 to pad the lead to 3-1 . Montreal killed off a late interference penalty to Andrei Markov _ and a 6-on-4 Boston opportunity _ to seal the win . The Bruins outshot Montreal 30-18 . The game drew two sellouts : 17,565 at TD Garden and some 21,000 at the Bell Centre , where fans paid $ 10 to watch the game on the video scoreboard with proceeds going to charity . They saw a contest in which both teams seemed at times weighed down by the occasion early on , knowing there could be an entire off-season to ponder a costly mistake . The Canadiens finished the regular season 17 points and eight places below the Bruins . But speedy Montreal , which had five wins and five losses in the 10 previous regular-season and playoff games in 2013-14 between the two , proved to be a handful all year for Boston . Yet the series was like rolling a boulder uphill for the Bruins , who rarely got their game going against Montreal . Boston coach Claude Julien had said Game 7s deserved your best . The Bruins failed to deliver for much of the night . The series has been a roller-coaster ride with no shortage of subplots , most of which involved P.K. Subban whose star continues to grow . When he was n't firing bullets from the blue-line or skating circles , the flamboyant Canadiens defenceman was dodging water aimed his way from the Boston bench and dealing with racism on social media . Subban embraced the attention and found himself in the spotlight again ahead of Game 7 when he pointed to the crowd , noise and energy in Boston 's TD Garden before saying : `` I ca n't wait to take that all away from them . '' Subban focused on the task at hand Wednesday , forgoing the flash . In a series where the team scoring the first goal had won all six previous outings , a fast start was mandatory . Especially when teams scoring first in Game 7s were 112-40 ( .737 ) . Advantage Montreal as the visitors went ahead on their first shot , thanks to the fourth line , at 2:18 after Tuukka Rask kicked out what looked like an innocent long shoot-in . But Brandon Prust retrieved the puck and found Briere who sent a pass through Matt Bartkowski and Daniel Paille in front . Weise swept it in from Rask 's doorstep . Boychuk and Gregory Campbell both tried to hit Prust on the play , opening space for others . The Bruins soon grew frustrated at the officiating , with first-period penalties to Brad Marchand ( goalie interference ) and Chara ( holding ) . Boston killed them off but looked disjointed and a little desperate at times , trying to force passes . The Bruins finally started throwing their weight around at the end of the period and had a gilt-edged charge after Patrice Bergeron stole the puck off a Canadiens defenceman . But Brad Marchand fired high from point-blank range . Price then had to stop a Carl Soderberg redirect . Boston outshot Montreal 9-6 after 20 minutes but had nothing to show for it . The second period started poorly for Boston with Marchand sent to the penalty box for unsportsmanlike conduct for a snow shower aimed at Price . That call prompted garbage thrown from the stands . Boston dug itself out of that hole and looked to fight back . Price waited out Bergeron as he drove at the goal , trying to get the goalie to commit . The Bruins outshot Montreal 7-1 at the start of the second period . But it was the Canadiens who scored at 10:22 after Boston failed to clear its zone . A diving Brandon Gallagher somehow found five-foot-seven David Desharnais , who emerged with the puck after Loui Eriksson , Soderberg and Bergeron failed to deal with it . Desharnais headed towards goal but rather than shooting , sent a no-look pass to Pacioretty to his right . The Montreal sniper rifled a shot into the goal before Rask could slide to the other side of the crease . Desharnais , under fire for his sub-par performance for much of the series , had a whale of game . Boston finally beat Price on the power play on an Iginla tip of a Torey Krug shot at 17:58 . The goal , which came with seven seconds left in a Pacioretty penalty , ended Price 's shutout streak of 103 minutes 46 seconds . The series was the 34th between the Bruins and Canadiens and marked the ninth time _ a record in North American pro sports _ that a Game 7 was required . Montreal held a 5-3 advantage in the eight prior Game 7s , but the teams had split the six such deciders in Boston . The Bruins had the last laugh last time out , with Nathan Horton scoring at 5:43 of overtime to give Boston a 4-3 victory in the 2011 Eastern Conference quarter-finals . Boston went on to win the Stanley Cup . Editor 's note : Comments which include offensive or inappropriate language will be deleted .

Experts on Dry January Experts give their views on whether a detox is essential to body functions and what happens in a month without booze . 04:09 , UK , Friday 12 January 2018 Image : Dry January reaches its midway point this weekend Mail By Rebecca Taylor , News Reporter All around the country , people are hitting the halfway mark in their January detoxes and getting to grips with their New Year 's resolutions . Whether it was to get to the gym more , eat more fruit and vegetables , or cut back on alcohol , there may be a slump around the corner requiring a new flex of willpower . But is there any point to a detox ? What really happens to your body when you give up the booze ? Should we all be trying to help our bodies cut out ` toxins ' ? Sky News spoke to experts to get the truth about the January detox . Yes to a detox - it 's a great opportunity Image : Dr Sarah Brewer says a detox helps take opportunity to reset your diet Dr Sarah Brewer , author of more than 60 self-help books , told Sky News : `` I think a detox is a great opportunity to review and address your diet and change things that are wrong with it . Most people recognise that they do n't eat enough fruit and vegetables , or protein . `` It is an opportunity to ditch the crap , and focus on a healthy diet . `` Avoiding alcohol is always a good thing to give your liver a rest . `` There is a lot of research to show supplements can help . If you take one thing , I recommend globe artichoke , to help the liver . `` During a detox , you eat a restricted selection of healthy and nutritious foods . You can eat as much or as little of these foods as you like , and do not necessarily need to lose weight . In practice , however , most people aim to halve their usual calorie intake to help boost the Detox process and to lose a few excess pounds . `` I do not recommend patches or colonics , it 's all about focusing on your diet and cutting back . '' No to a detox - your liver does the job Image : Rhiannon Lambert says nothing detoxes like the liver Leading Harley Street Nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert said : `` The good news is that that we all already have a detoxification system . It 's called the liver and no tea , juice cleanse or diet will do it 's job any better . `` Any suggestion that the human body can be detoxed with a tea , juice cleanse or patch is incorrect . We are naturally designed to remove toxins using our liver and kidneys - none of these perform such a detox . These items often prey on those individuals desperate for a quick fix or simply to feel healthier , when in reality just addressing their overall diet and lifestyle will work wonders and cost less . `` The idea that we kind do some kind of purge and purify our bodies is an attractive thought but the reality is you simply need to eat well most of the time . If you accept the marketing of any supposed detox , you 're abandoning proven science . `` Food is n't strictly speaking medicine and encouraging people to see some food as toxic and others as pure is dangerous . In my experience , all detoxes do is push you into extreme calorie restriction . An obsession with a rule-driven way of eating like so-called detoxing is familiar to so many people with disordered eating . '' Image : Dry January has side effects like losing weight and saving money She added : `` There is no denying that alcohol should be limited as part of a healthy diet . All too often I see alcohol associated with weight gain and poor mental clarity . Any positive claims from alcohol stem largely from studies using quality red wine and often on males over the age of 50 . There is a lot of research investigating the powerful plant compounds in red wine and their health benefits , including reduced inflammation , lower risk of heart disease and extended lifespan . `` Choose your alcohol wisely and remember that alcohol can be addictive and excessive consumption can cause a whole host of health issues . '' Dry January : What happens after you give up alcohol ? Many people may now be starting to see some differences in their appearance and their wellbeing as they make it to the second weekend in January without alcohol . In general , those who give up alcohol for one to two weeks report better quality of sleep , and see improvements in their skin . According to Drinkaware , drinking alcohol helps people to drop off to sleep quicker , but it prevents the body staying in deep sleep , and entering REM cycles ( rapid eye movement ) . This means while the glass of red might send you to sleep , it 'll make you groggy the next day too . Image : Friends Ruari and Andy set up One Year No Beer Reducing alcohol intake could also benefit your skin , as it 's a diuretic , meaning it makes you dehydrated . Cutting back will help your skin and eyes to sparkle . Many people report weight loss , as the empty calories of alcohol are replaced with lower calories alternatives , and making up lbs with pounds when they do n't get tied into rounds at the pub . Friends Andy Ramage and Ruari Fairburns gave up alcohol for a year after becoming fed up of late nights and hangovers entertaining clients in the City of London . Now , they 've written a book together , The 28 Day Alcohol Free Challenge , and run programmes encouraging people to knock the pints on the head for as long as they can , from 28 days to 365 . Mr Fairburns said : `` We have worked with the University of Stirling and we 've found that people who do our programme get an ` epiphany ' moment somewhere between 20 and 60 days . `` This epiphany is ' I feel amazing ' . It happens to nearly everyone who regularly drinks more than 14 units a week , four large glasses of wine . Image : Andy 's body changed dramatically when he stopped drinking `` They think ' I feel limitless ' . Many people who stick to our 28 days end up staying to do 90 days or longer without alcohol . '' He added that humans naturally want to fit into a tribe , and for some tribes , they can be defensive when one member stops drinking . But the key can be finding a tribe with a different common interest , or who can help keep you on the no alcohol path .

Thomas answered with two clutch wedge shots , two big putts and sailed to a 4-under 68 to secure a three-shot victory over Patrick Cantlay , who gave him a battle to the end with a 65 . `` Patrick played unbelievably , put a lot of heat on me , '' Thomas said . `` In the end , it could have been good for me . It kept me focused , kept my head down . ... I was really nervous going into today . I remembered that it 's really hard to win a golf tournament , and I 'm glad that I was able to do so . '' The timing was ideal . His first victory since the World Golf Championship at Firestone last year moved him to the top of the FedEx Cup going into the Tour Championship , where he will start the tournament at 10-under par with a two-shot lead under the new scoring format as the final 30 players chase a $ 15 million first prize . `` I can certainly say I never slept on a Wednesday lead , '' Thomas said . Cantlay , who made four straight birdies around the turn , secured the No. 2 position and will start at 8 under . Brooks Koepka will be 7 under , a staggered start all the way down to even par for the final five players . TENNIS MASON , Ohio ( AP ) - Two unexpected champions embraced their first Rookwood championship trophies , concluding a week that brought more questions than clarity to the upcoming U.S. Open . Who 's going to be healthy on the women 's side ? Will stumbles in the men 's bracket at the Western & Southern Open carry over to New York ? And are Madison Keys and Daniil Medvedev capable of carrying their newfound momentum into a Grand Slam event ? After winning the biggest tournament title of their careers , they were already getting asked about how it might transfer to the bigger stage . Keys rallied late in both sets and beat Svetlana Kuznetsova 7-5 , 7-6 ( 5 ) for her second title of the season and easily the biggest of her career . After flameouts in her last three tournaments and a tough draw for the week , she could n't imagine the outcome . Back on the court to receive the trophy , she told the crowd : `` If you told me this is where I would be a week ago , I would have laughed in your face ! '' Medvedev beat David Goffin 7-6 ( 3 ) , 6-4 for his first Masters 1000 title . It was his third straight final , but the first time he had won . Medvedev lost to Rafael Nadal on Montreal a week earlier , then went on to reach his sixth final of this season , most on the ATP tour . He 's won twice . `` To finally lift the trophy this week is an amazing feeling , '' Medvedev said . NFL EAST RUTHERFORD , N.J. ( AP ) - Le\u2019Veon Bell will have to wait a little longer for his debut with the New York Jets . Coach Adam Gase announced that the star running back will be held out of the team 's final two preseason games . `` I was about 99 % sure heading into the preseason , '' Gase said after the Jets ' practice at MetLife Stadium . `` It was all based off of how he practiced , conditioning and all those types of things . '' Gase and Bell spoke about the plan when training camp started , and Bell 's snaps increased in practice last week . Bell has looked good in training camp after sitting out all last season in a contract dispute with Pittsburgh . Gase and the Jets do n't want to take any unnecessary risks with Bell . `` We 'll just get him as game ready as possible , '' Gase said . `` He 's not really going to know until we get into a real game , but I feel like he 's in great shape and he 's been contacting about as good as anybody on the practice field . `` So , I feel confident he 'll be ready to go ( in ) Week 1 . '' That would be the regular-season opener against Buffalo on Sept. 8 . It will mark the first time Bell will play in a game since the Steelers ' playoff loss to Jacksonville on Jan. 14 , 2018 - a span of nearly 20 months . `` I 'll see y ' all in September , '' Bell wrote on Twitter about an hour after Gase 's announcement . AUTO RACING LONG POND , Pa. ( AP ) - The black clouds that enveloped Pocono and officially brought the IndyCar race to a premature end did n't appear until the halfway point . But they 've really been hanging over the track since the series returned to the mountains in 2013 . A fatal crash . A promising career wrecked by paralysis . And again Sunday , a first-lap demolition derby that sent another driver to the hospital and stirred an angry mob howling for IndyCar to get the heck out of town once and for all . It may be a moot point , IndyCar and Pocono do n't have a deal for a 2020 race . But for Robert Wickens , the Canadian confined to a wheelchair after last year 's accident , IndyCar has no place on the 2\u00a01/2 - mile superspeedway . `` How many times do we have to go through the same situation before we can all accept that an IndyCar should not race at Pocono , '' he tweeted . The counter argument was posed from the Australian snapping victory lane photos inside a cramped Pocono media center as rain pounded the track outside . Will Power was in the right position Sunday to claim the win when lightning struck in the area to not only win the race , he ended the potential for his first winless season since 2006 and he took the checkered flag at Pocono for the third time in four years . `` I really hope we come back , I do , '' Power said . `` It 's hard for us to find good ovals that suit our cars . '' IndyCar at Pocono has turned into perhaps the scariest race day in auto racing , 500 miles of danger for drivers on the 2\u00a01/2 - mile track and white knuckles and clasped hands for anyone watching the event . The green flag had barely been dropped when 2017 Indianapolis 500 winner Takuma Sato used an aggressive - arguably foolish - move to trigger a wreck that sent Felix Rosenqvist to the hospital . Sato tried to shoot a gap on the first lap , cut off Alexander Rossi and connected with Ryan Hunter-Reay in a crash that left cars and debris strewn across the track . Sato 's car landed upside down on Hunter-Reay 's Honda . `` I ca n't even begin to understand how after last year Takuma thinks that 's acceptable , '' Rossi said . `` It 's disgraceful . '' Rosenqvist hit the fence nose first and his car slammed back on the track . Rosenqvist did not suffer life-threatening injuries and was cleared . `` Definitely feel lucky escaping without any serious injuries after visiting the catch fence there , '' he tweeted . ___", "date": "2019-08-19 03:02:08", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/aug/19/weekend-sports-in-brief/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS", "phase": "E", "title": "Weekend Sports in Brief The Washington Times , LLC", "names": [{"name": "justin thomas", "ids": ["Q15877245", "Q19666564", "Q22098319", "Q51084062", "Q52504008", "Q775036"], "offsets": [[47, 49], [75, 76], [104, 105], [156, 157], [294, 295]]}, {"name": "patrick cantlay", "ids": ["Q2595850"], "offsets": [[127, 129], [143, 144], [297, 298]]}, {"name": "brooks koepka", "ids": ["Q749702"], "offsets": [[320, 322]]}, {"name": "madison keys", "ids": ["Q34403"], "offsets": [[409, 411], [451, 452]]}, {"name": "daniil medvedev", "ids": ["Q21622022"], "offsets": [[412, 414], [542, 543], [574, 575], [622, 623]]}, {"name": "svetlana kuznetsova", "ids": ["Q192064", "Q21063641", "Q3978501", "Q4245117"], "offsets": [[459, 461]]}, {"name": "david goffin", "ids": ["Q19406"], "offsets": [[544, 546]]}, {"name": "rafael nadal", "ids": ["Q10132"], "offsets": [[577, 579]]}, {"name": "adam gase", "ids": ["Q4679094"], "offsets": [[653, 655], [687, 688], [718, 719], [760, 761], [788, 789], [914, 915]]}, {"name": "robert wickens", "ids": ["Q113936", "Q39385430"], "offsets": [[1039, 1041]]}, {"name": "takuma sato", "ids": ["Q171297"], "offsets": [[1257, 1259], [1279, 1280], [1312, 1313], [1335, 1336]]}, {"name": "felix rosenqvist", "ids": ["Q1403778"], "offsets": [[1273, 1275], [1351, 1352], [1366, 1367]]}, {"name": "alexander rossi", "ids": ["Q559962"], "offsets": [[1292, 1294], [1342, 1343]]}, {"name": "ryan hunter-reay", "ids": ["Q589204"], "offsets": [[1297, 1299], [1319, 1320]]}]}, {"articleID": "2011091604_00043130_W", "content": "cincinnati - jay bruce 's first game-ending home run of the season did n't have the impact of his last one . still it reminded the reds of the success they had a year ago . bruce hit a two-run homer in the 11th inning that lifted the cincinnati reds to an 8-6 win over the chicago cubs on thursday night . the right fielder 's last game-winner came 50 weeks ago off houston 's tim byrdak on sept. 28 to clinch the central division title . cincinnati reds starting pitcher homer bailey throws against the chicago cubs in the first inning of a baseball game on thursday , sept. 15 , 2011 , in cincinnati . - al behrman / ap photo cincinnati reds center fielder drew stubbs ( 6 ) can not reach a two-run home run hit by chicago cubs ' marlon byrd off starting pitcher homer bailey in the first inning of a baseball game on thursday , sept. 15 , 2011 , in cincinnati . - al behrman / ap photo chicago cubs ' marlon byrd rounds the bases after hitting a two-run home run off cincinnati reds starting pitcher homer bailey , background right , in the first inning of a baseball game on thursday , sept. 15 , 2011 , in cincinnati . - al behrman / ap photo click for more photos today 's news video `` they 're awesome , '' bruce said . `` it shows resiliency . it shows we have n't given up . that 's my third walk off . the other two were in tighter situations but they 've all been great .

'' `` We are well beyond the point that any disinterested person can deny that the president abused his power and acted in a corrupt manner , in ways the American founders explicitly warned against , '' Wehner writes . ADVERTISEMENT According to Wehner , yesterday 's hearing only deepened the `` complicity '' of Republicans in Trump 's latest scandal . Wehner goes on to write that it 's not just the `` partisanship and political tribalism '' that makes the Trump era so unusual . `` It is the degree to which the transgressive nature of Trump -- his willingness to go places no other president has gone , to say and do things that no president before him has done -- has exposed the Republican Party . '' The end goal for the Republican party , Wehner says , is to `` defend Trump at all costs . '' One can be critical of Democrats and also believe the following : ADVERTISEMENT `` The Republican Party under Donald Trump is a party built largely on lies , and it is now maintained by politicians and supporters who are willing to ` live within the lie , ' to quote the great Czech dissident ( and later president ) V\u00e1clav Havel . Many congressional Republicans privately admit this but , with very rare exceptions -- Senator Mitt Romney of Utah is the most conspicuous example -- refuse to publicly acknowledge it .

Wallace said , `` the impeachment proceedings into Donald Trump threaten to consume his presidency . '' `` The public phase of that effort and the investigative aspect of the impeachment process are now speeding down two parallel tracks , '' she explained . `` The second public hearing is underway at 9:00 A.M. tomorrow morning -- while the closed-door investigative track of the impeachment proceedings presses on gaining new steam with yesterday 's dramatic revelation from Ambassador Bill Taylor about a previously unknown phone conversation between Donald Trump and his ambassador to the E.U. in which Trump asks specifically about the investigations .

In an interview with CNN , registered Republican Boyce O'Brien said that he 's been `` so disappointed '' watching the way GOP lawmakers have bent over backwards to make excuses for the president 's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden . `` It 's embarrassing to me to be affiliated with it at this point , '' said O'Brien , who acknowledges that he could n't stomach voting for Trump in 2016 despite backing past nominees George W. Bush , John McCain and Mitt Romney . `` My hope they 'll finally develop a backbone and stand up for what 's right .

Actually , two frenzies , since they 've now got two wars to cover , one of which has provided shots of a grisly plane crash . This all meant that a lot of oxygen was sucked from the normal political news scene , meaning this week 's column will be somewhat abbreviated . Both wars did n't really impact America all that much , so there 's not a lot to add to the media cacophony on either one , to put this another way . The biggest political event of the week ( for Democrats , at any rate ) was Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats rolling out a new campaign agenda -- the `` Middle Class Jumpstart '' -- in the tradition of Newt Gingrich 's `` Contract With America . '' But we 'll have much more on this later , as we 're turning over the whole talking points portion of the program to this rollout . In other Democratic campaign agenda news , Carl Gibson of the a great article which starkly lays out the difference between two states that charted separate ideological budgetary paths during the recession : Kansas and California . In a nutshell , Kansas decided to massively cut taxes and California not-so-massively raised taxes on the wealthiest . The result ? California 's economy ( and budget ) is now almost fully recovered , and the Kansas economy is now in the toilet . Kansas saw its incoming revenues plummet , and their bond rating was downgraded as a result . This is one of the best evidence-based articles on the aftermath of the philosophical differences between Republicans and Democrats , and is well worth reading in full . The annual liberal blogger/activist Netroots Nation conference is happening this week , but sadly we decided not to attend , so we have no news from Detroit for you ( sorry about that ) . The Senate effectively got within three votes of essentially overturning the Hobby Lobby Supreme Court decision . Senator Barbara Boxer wrote a wonderful piece on the issue this week , as well . The House -- astonishingly -- actually passed a much-needed bill to continue funding highway and infrastructure projects , even if it was nothing more than another short-term stopgap bill . Hey , a stopgap is better than stopping the government , right ? This should be seen as a clear victory for the Establishment Republicans over the Tea Party , it 's worth mentioning . In funny candidate news , Republican Scott Brown verbally tripped over his carpetbag , once again . Hey Scott , it helps when running for office to remember what state you 're actually in ! Ask any rock star , they 'll tell you the crowd does indeed notice when you blow this line . Heh . In Arizona , a Republican congressional candidate was trying to fan the flames of the immigration issue , but instead wrongly identified a busload of Y.M.C.A. campers as Central American children . Whoops ! a fake Senate candidate to consider : Gil Fulbright . His ad his hilarious , and starts with : Hi , I 'm Gil Fulbright . The people who run my campaign , they 've made this commercial -- and I 'm in it . This campaign -- it 's not about me , it 's about crafting a version of me that will appeal to you . A version that visits random worksites with paid actors pointing at things . A version of me that does n't find old people loathsome or pointless . The people behind the effort are making a strong point about money in politics , and doing so in a very funny way , we have to say . Not-as-fake ( but still pretty laughable ) candidate Thomas Ravenel is running for Senate down in South Carolina . He 's not only been on reality television , but he 's also been previously convicted of drug trafficking . I do n't think Lindsey Graham 's very worried , personally . Speaking of politicians ( well , `` ex-politicians '' ) and drugs , there are some highly amusing photos of Tom Tancredo joshing around with some legal marijuana in Colorado , if you have n't yet seen them . a great summary of the most-important legislative marijuana news of the week ( which is worth checking out ) up on Huffington Post , if you 're interested in more detail . Washington , D.C. is still locked in a struggle with Congress over decriminalization , and the White House weighed in strongly on the local government 's side . A unanimous decision was just announced by the U.S. Sentencing Commission that new sentencing standards for non-violent federal drug offenses will actually be applied retroactively -- which could give tens of thousands of prisoners shorter sentences to serve . And , finally , a research scientist at the University of Arizona was just fired -- coincidentally , right after she received federal approval to study marijuana 's effect on P.T.S.D. in returning soldiers . She describes herself thus : `` I am a lifelong Republican , and I am very conservative . '' But that has n't stopped plenty of liberals from supporting her , by signing a petition to get her reinstated in her job . As of this writing , there are close to 32,000 signatures on the petition , so why not take a minute and add yours to the list ? Let 's see , what else ? The majority of the American public already thinks John Boehner 's idea of suing the president is a gigantic waste of time ( and the lawsuit has n't even really begun , mind you ) . Oh , and just about anybody can automatically now become a political non-profit group , because the I.R.S. just totally threw in the towel and admitted that they were n't even going to screen all but the largest new tax-exempt organizations . So maybe we should form a `` Friday Talking Points '' non-profit , so we can get lotsa money that our donors can write off on their taxes . After all , there 's nothing really stopping anyone from doing exactly that , now . Only in America ! Joe Biden deserves at least an Honorable Mention this week , for singlehandedly raising the profile of the annual Netroots Nation liberal conference . Because Biden 's speech coincided with the Malaysian Airlines crash ( Biden 's was one of the first official statements on the crash ) , there were a whole lot of clips on the news with the `` Netroots Nation '' background . Alan Grayson also deserves an Honorable Mention force the House to vote on increasing the minimum wage for federal employees . Keep fighting the good fight , Alan ! We have two Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week awards to hand out this week , and the first goes to Shenna Bellows , the Democratic candidate for Senate in Maine . Now , Bellows is a longshot , since Susan Collins is one of the more reasonable Republicans in the Senate , and she is well-loved in her home state . So Bellows decided to stage a political stunt of sorts , but an impressive one nonetheless : she 's going to personally walk the length of Maine , to meet the voters . The best line from the story : `` She will reportedly be outfitted in Maine-made New Balance sneakers and an L.L. Bean raincoat . '' Nice . Now , this sort of small-town campaigning would n't work in a larger state , and her chances for victory in November are slim , but we have to say that it does show an astounding amount of personal dedication to walk over 300 miles in a bid to get elected . Even if she loses , she deserves a MIDOTW for her long walk . The second MIDOTW goes to none other than House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi . Pelosi is just about the only Democrat showing some optimism about their chances in House races this year , but then that 's actually just part of her leadership job . But she really earned the award for rolling out a `` Contract With America '' sort of campaign platform for Democrats to support this year . It is called the `` Middle Class Jumpstart '' agenda , which is a pretty good name for what Democrats stand for in general . Pelosi unveiled the agenda with other House leaders in a press conference , which we 're going to quote from in a moment . Pelosi has a tough row to hoe in this year 's midterms . The sixth year of any president is a tough one for his party in Congress , traditionally , but Pelosi is going to give it all she 's got to try and pick up seats for Democrats this year . Whether she 's ultimately successful or not , the fact that she 's fighting hard is a lot better than if Democrats had just decided to roll over and give up . So , for both her eternal optimism and for providing a ready-made platform for Democratic candidates this fall , Nancy Pelosi has earned herself another Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week . [ Shenna Bellows is a candidate for office , and it is our standing policy not to link to candidate web pages . Congratulate House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi on her House contact page , to let her know you appreciate her efforts . ] We had no candidates this week for the Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week award , since no Democrat uttered a cringe-worthy line all week long . At least , that we are aware of -- if we 've overlooked some disappointing behavior , please feel free to make nominations in the comments , as always . Instead , we have an award in the technical category . We 're not sure who 's responsible , and it is likely some non-partisan technical official , but we have to create a `` Back To The Drawing Board '' award for whoever was responsible for the microphones in the White House press room . The press room was recently refurbished and upgraded , to the delight of the White House press corps . But , after watching this morning 's press conference , we have to wonder who is responsible for the sound quality in the room . Because instead of hearing the president and the press interacting , what you instead mostly hear is : `` CLICK ! CLICK ! CLICK ! CLICK ! CLICK ! '' The still photographers ' cameras are the loudest I think I 've ever heard , which is likely due to choosing omnidirectional microphones for the podium and the questioners ' microphone . The annoying camera sounds were so loud that it was impossible to hear some of the questions , in fact . This is after , mind you , spending a whole bunch of money upgrading the room . So , to whoever is responsible for the sound quality , please either get directional microphones or install a sound filter to dull the loudness of the camera clicking . And enjoy your `` Back To The Drawing Board '' award . [ Since we have no idea who is responsible for this sort of thing , we can not provide any contact information , sorry . Volume 312 ( 7/18/14 ) Political historians differ over the relative influence that Newt Gingrich 's `` Contract With America '' actually had on the voting public . Some say not many people even knew what Newt was talking about , and some say it was the theme that won Republicans a big victory . Historical quibbles aside , though , it is indeed a tactic well worth emulating . Political campaigns are supposed to be all about drawing contrasts between the political parties . Not very many people actually ever read the political parties ' official platform documents , so highlighting a few specific legislative agenda items is worth attempting . It gets the message out in a concrete way : '' this is what we will do if elected . '' In true Gingrichian fashion , Democrats are promising to achieve all of these things `` in the first 100 days '' of the new Congress , should they regain control of the House . So the Democratic leadership held a press event , to announce their 2014 campaign agenda . Here is Representative Steve Israel , giving an overview of what this will include , by way of an introduction : Middle Class Jumpstart . '' It is to jumpstart the middle class -- 100 days of action to put the middle class first , ahead of the special interests . Now , you could n't have a more vivid contrast in priorities . They [ Republicans ] have passed maximum subsidies for the special interests . In the first 100 days , we [ Democrats ] will increase the minimum wage for America 's workers -- first 100 days . They have protected the profits of the big banks . In the first 100 days , we will allow every student in the middle class and working families to refinance their student loans . In their House majority , they have supported putting bosses in charge of women 's health freedoms . In the first 100 days , we will require bosses to pay a woman the same as a man for equal work . That 's the difference between them and us : 100 days . Putting the middle class first . More jobs , not more subpoenas . More jobs for the middle class , not more jobs for partisan lawyers . Supporting women and families , supporting affordable and accessible education . This quote ( and all the talking points below ) come from the transcript of this press event , which was held this week on the steps of the Capitol ( again , matching Newt 's rollout idea ) . This is a ready-made campaign platform for any Democratic House candidate to use this year , and it deserves more attention than it has so far received . Which is why we 're turning the entire section over to the rollout event . Nancy Pelosi herself came up with a few snappy lines that are even shorter than `` talking points , '' being more in the `` bumpersticker slogan '' category . For instance , in touting a `` Make It In America '' idea , Pelosi came up with a simple refrain : '' ` A ' and ` B ' : American-made ; Build it in America . '' This was probably the best she came up with , although she also contributed `` Children learning , parents earning , '' which has a nice rhyming quality but is less overtly political upon first glance . And then there was one for the inside-the-Beltway types : `` Republicans are about process , Democrats are about progress '' ( this , in reaction to `` partisan lawsuits against the president '' -- hey , I warned you it was wonky ) . She also led a call-and-response towards the end , which consisted of her prompting : `` When the middle class succeeds ... when families succeed ... when women succeed '' which was followed by rousing choruses of `` America succeeds ! '' from her fellow Democrats . But we 're going to use seven longer excerpts from the event ( longer than soundbites , in other words ) , so let 's get on with it . Here are the best talking points from the rollout event , in the order they were delivered . Representative Xavier Becerra got things rolling , by drawing a clear and sharp contrast between the two parties . [ W ] e are gathered here today to send a very clear message to America : you can either sue the President of the United States , or you can do your job here in the House of Representatives and pass laws that help the middle class and working families . You can shut down the government , taking 800,000 workers and 24 billion taxpayer dollars with you ; or you can enact the president 's jobs agenda . You can vote more than 50 times to tear down America 's new health security and patients ' law , or you can make the law even better so every working family in America has a doctor and the peace of mind that comes with it . You can pass stopgap measures that merely kick the can down the road on our nation 's budget or on the construction and repair of our roads , rails , and bridges , or you can do it the right way and pass stable , long-term laws that give our businesses and employers the confidence to hire and grow . You can do nothing other than block a vote to fix a broken immigration system , or you can pass the bipartisan fix that the Senate voted out 384 days ago . A Republican do-nothing and do-bad-things Congress Minority Whip Steny Hoyer began introducing the specific pieces of legislation that make up the Middle Class Jumpstart plan . He also got in a real zinger , at the end . The `` Make It In America '' plan is a broad agenda for jobs and competitiveness and is a central part of this `` Middle Class Jumpstart . '' We want to provide tax incentives to encourage companies to bring jobs home , rather than send jobs overseas . We want to invest in increased exports , improved infrastructures and skill-training programs that attract jobs and promote a strong manufacturing base . Democrats have a real plan to get things done . And if we have the majority in January , as I fully expect us to have , we will be introducing the `` 21st Century Make It In America Act . '' Americans are tired of a Republican do-nothing and do-bad-things Congress focused simply on partisan divisions . Build America Representative Jim Clyburn was n't as focused , but did introduce the Democratic infrastructure agenda item . Republicans voted to give tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas . House Democrats will pass the `` Build American Bonds Act '' to boost job growth and modernize American infrastructures by building roads , bridges , broadband technology , and investing in clean energy . And we will pay for it by closing corporate tax loopholes . Republicans have blocked legislation to make long-term investments in our nation 's aging highway system and oppose creating clean energy jobs for the future . House Democrats will raise the minimum wage to $ 10.10 an hour and pass the `` Tax Fairness Act '' to deny CEOs the ability to claim tax deductions for pay over $ 1 million , unless they give their employees a raise . Republicans refused to raise the minimum wage , but give massive tax giveaways to corporate special interests and the ultra-wealthy . Congressman Chris Van Hollen went next , and provided a bit more detail . [ T ] wo things we 're going to do in those first 100 days . The first is end the scandal that in America , you can work 40 hours a week all year long and still have to raise your family in poverty . That is simply wrong . We need to make sure we raise the minimum wage to $ 10.10 an hour and get that done once and for all . But we can not stop there . We need to make sure all of America has a shot at a wage . What we 've seen over the last several decades is large increases in worker productivity . We have seen skyrocketing increases in CEO pay and bonuses . What we have not seen is increases in the employee pay . They have been left behind even though they are working to boost that productivity and boost those corporate profits . So , we have a very simple proposition . We have a proposition called the `` CEO-Employee Pay Fairness Act , '' and that is this : if you 're a corporation , you can not give your CEO and top executives -- you can not take a deduction for their pay over $ 1 million unless you 're going to give your employees a raise . It 's pretty simple . It 's pretty fair . Representative John Tierney introduced his bill to allow all students and former students to refinance their student loan debt . What this bill does is provide existing student loan borrowers the opportunity to refinance their debt at a lower rate . Banks can do it . Businesses can do it . Families can do it with their home ownership . And students should be able to do it . It would save students and parents and graduates thousands of dollars on their loans . And that savings no doubt will get spent right back into the economy , giving it a boost . The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office says clearly that it would reduce the deficit by $ 22 billion in 10 years , so taxpayers also benefit from it . Right now , the House Republicans are in there trying to find out how to sue the president . We 're out here making sure that we 're fighting for tens of millions of parents and students and graduates to make sure that they have an equal chance . This is all about : whose side are you on ? And we 're on the side of students and graduates and parents . From Day One Representative Joe Crowley went next , expanding on the education theme . [ E ] ducation does n't start at college . And we also know that our children only have one real shot -- one real shot at a quality education . And it 's imperative that they get off to the right start , the right jumpstart . Decades of studies have found that quality pre-school not only leads to higher academic achievement and stronger job benefits , but it also lowers crime and delinquency levels -- and even more importantly , it reduces poverty , which really is the cause for the prior two issues . So while House Republicans voted to limit access to early childhood education and essentially squashed the hopes and dreams of America 's children , House Democrats will pass legislation to expand access to education and make the investments needed to set our children on a path of future success . Our legislation , the `` Strong Start for America 's Children Act '' ... is a bold , ten-year , federal/state partnership to expand and improve early learning opportunities for our children . This bill will expand access to pre-school for four-year-olds and make critical investments to improve the quality of child care for infants and toddlers . We want to jumpstart the middle class , and that must include jumpstarting our children 's education -- not when they 're going to college , but from Day One . Majority Leader Pelosi finished up the laundry list , with a measure targeted directly at women voters . This one has a snappier title than other agenda items , which could make it more memorable to the voters . Pelosi , in general , is a lot better at presenting complex legislative ideas as snappy soundbites . But one of the best actions that we can take to increase and grow our economy is to increase the role of women in our economy . Our agenda for women and families is `` When Women Succeed , America Succeeds . '' This is not just the title of our agenda ; this is a statement of absolute fact . And our agenda presents a stark contrast to what the Republicans have done to roll back women 's rights and limit women 's opportunities .

'' guess which one has stronger qi and by eating it will transfer that vibrant qi to your body ? we are born with a finite amount of qi referred to as our `` ancestral qi '' . it resides in the kidney energetic system or `` ming men '' . we expend it throughout our lives . in order to create longevity and a good quality of life we must nurture and preserve our ancestral qi with a balanced lifestyle . we can also replace some qi by taking in food , water and breath . the quality of what we put in our bodies directly affects the quality of qi that we manifest . when someone is strong and vital with stamina , glowing skin and shiny hair they have abundant qi . when someone is graceful in movement and demeanor , is intuitive and soothing to be around they have harmonious qi . when someone is pale , tired and weak they have deficient qi . people can have confused qi and refined qi when clear thinking . people can exchange qi through touch and emotions . we are always changed by our contact with others , animals too . therapy dogs in a cancer infusion room reduce side effects . stroking your cat brings down your blood pressure . working in the garden , our hands in the qi rich earth , reconnects us with our wholeness . qi is supposed to flow evenly throughout our meridians and their associated organs and tissues . when qi becomes stuck , deficient or out of balance we have pain , emotional upset and disease . qi imbalance can have internal and external causes . excessive emotions can cause qi stagnation . trauma , anger , grief and even excessive joy can cause imbalance . weather , excessive activity , pathogens like viruses and bacteria and accidents can derange qi . our wei qi is the defensive system flowing in the superficial meridians of the body , protecting us from external pathogens . gu qi is the qi our bodies make from food that drives the fire of digestion and our biochemical functions . ancestral qi , received from our parents decides our constitutional make up . three thousand years before science discovered genes chinese medicine recognized that our vital essence was affected by how we treated our bodies . it was understood that irreparable harm could be done by living an excessive and toxic lifestyle . now we know that exposure to toxins , excessive stress and viruses can damage our genes and cause serious illness . in chinese medicine qi flow and balance equals health . tai qi , qi gung and yoga are movement practices that support qi flow . any moderate excercise is good . laughter warms the whole body with qi . good food and sleep nurture our qi . but when we are so out of balance that we have illness the acupuncture and herbs of chinese medicine can help . an acupuncturist will diagnose the imbalance by considering the symptoms , looking at the tongue and taking the pulses . there are twelve pulses that reflect the state of qi in each of the twelve main meridians . the acupuncture points for treatment are chosen based on the diagnosis made using all this information . the goal of treatment is always to balance and strengthen the qi of the patient based on their individual and unique presentation . kathleen macgregor is an acupuncturist with an office in meiners oaks . previous experiencing the element of metal in autumn . kathleen macgregor l.ac . like be the first to like this post .", "date": "2010-11-29 04:33:29", "url": "http://5elementhealer.wordpress.com/2010/11/29/what-is-qi/", "phase": "C", "title": "what is qi ? ? articles by kathleen", "names": [{"name": "gu qi", "ids": ["Q45409210", "Q45476894", "Q45505043", "Q45545452", "Q45566924", "Q45644299"], "offsets": [[16, 17], [33, 34], [51, 52], [53, 54], [68, 69], [87, 88], [92, 93], [168, 169], [177, 178], [190, 191], [197, 198], [238, 239], [249, 250], [273, 274], [295, 296], [316, 317], [329, 330], [335, 336], [338, 339], [346, 347], [394, 395], [404, 405], [421, 422], [439, 440], [452, 453], [482, 483], [506, 508], [510, 511], [528, 529], [604, 605], [612, 613], [614, 615], [623, 624], [638, 639], [646, 647], [699, 700], [736, 737]]}, {"name": "wei qi", "ids": ["Q18110198", "Q45420862", "Q45434428", "Q45435254", "Q45448419", "Q45481131", "Q45520242", "Q45563305", "Q45591415", "Q45622346", "Q45649000", "Q45655691", "Q45657734", "Q45692562", "Q45703250", "Q45707342", "Q45707359", "Q45707517", "Q45708544"], "offsets": [[485, 487]]}]}, {"articleID": "2018121712_01199813_W", "content": "Facial recognition technology The Metropolitan Police has started new trials of controversial live facial recognition technology in parts of Westminster in a bid to reduce crime around the area . Privacy rights group Big Brother Watch has called the move `` dangerous '' . It argues it is a `` breach of fundamental rights to privacy and freedom of speech and assembly '' but the police say people can decline to be scanned without arousing suspicion . -- Where is the trial taking place and how long for ? The latest trial of live facial recognition technology will take place across parts of Soho , Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square on December 17 and 18 . Police will deploy the system for about eight hours each day to provide enough time for it to be tested . This morning officers from across Westminster are accompanied by the Violent Crime Taskforce & ward officers from @MPSSoho whilst testing is carried out of the latest facial recognition technology . #Soho #Technology For more info head to : https://t.co/a0rGQrY8Bx pic.twitter.com/83hDOBikiR -- MPS Westminster ( @MPSWestminster ) December 17 , 2018 -- Why are the police using facial recognition technology ? The Metropolitan Police hopes live facial recognition technology will help reduce crime , especially violent incidents , and could be used as a tactic to deter people from offending . They claim trialling the system in real life conditions will enable them to gather accurate data and learn as much as possible . -- Is the public being made aware of the trial ? Yes , the Metropolitan Police said it is making people aware the trial is under way with posters displayed around the affected areas . There will be a `` clear uniformed presence '' of the technology , with information leaflets being handed out to members of the public . This is one of the facial recognition vans out in London today at Cambridge Circus . This looks an awful lot like covert surveillance . Also plain clothed officers hanging around . pic.twitter.com/JNGINzvR6A -- Big Brother Watch ( @bbw1984 ) December 17 , 2018 -- How does the technology work ? The Metropolitan Police uses facial recognition technology called NeoFace , developed by Japanese IT firm NEC , which matches faces up to a so-called watch list of offenders wanted by the police and courts for existing offences . Cameras scan faces in its view measuring the structure of each face , creating a digital version that is searched up against the watch list . If a match is detected , an officer on the scene is alerted , who will be able to see the camera image and the watch list image , before deciding whether to stop the individual . -- Are faces stored in a database ? The Metropolitan Police said it will only keep faces matching the watch list for up to 30 days -- all other data is deleted immediately . -- Can you refuse to be scanned ? Yes , people can refuse to be scanned without being viewed as suspicious , although the Metropolitan Police said `` there must be additional information available to support such a view '' . -- Is this the first facial recognition trial ? The Metropolitan Police has previously tested the system at major events , such as Notting Hill Carnival and Remembrance Day , as well as at the Port of Hull docks and Stratford transport hub . South Wales Police have also tried the technology at various events including the Uefa Champions League 2017 final in Cardiff , international rugby matches and Liam Gallagher and Kasabian concerts . ( Nick Ansell/PA ) -- How accurate is the technology ? Trials in London and Wales have had mixed results so far . In May , the Metropolitan Police released figures showing it had identified 102 false positives -- cases where someone was incorrectly matched to a photo -- with only two correct matches . Neither resulted in arrest , as one was no longer wanted by police , while the other was classed as a `` fixated individual '' who attended a Remembrance Day event . South Wales Police said its trial results improved after changes to the algorithm used to identify people . The system allowed it to make four arrests during the autumn internationals rugby , one arrest and two people ordered to leave at a Kasabian concert , and five arrests during the Six Nations rugby . The force also made two arrests in Cardiff as part of Operation Fulcrum and a further two in a similar operation in Swansea . A report by South Wales Police said the system struggled in large crowds and in darkness , as well as against people wearing glasses or hats . The mobile app also frequently failed or was slow getting alerts to intervention teams . -- What next ? The Metropolitan Police have indicated future deployments could be considered for football sporting events , music festivals and more transport hubs . `` We continue to engage with many different stakeholders , some who actively challenge our use of this technology , '' said Ivan Balhatchet , strategic lead for live facial technology at the Metropolitan Police . `` In order to show transparency and continue constructive debate , we have invited individuals and groups with varying views on our use of facial recognition technology to this deployment .

Joseph Maguire appears before the Senate Intelligence Committee to be confirmed as the director of the National Counterterrorism Center , in July 2018 . J. Scott Applewhite / AP Originally published on August 8 , 2019 9:22 pm Updated at 10:22 p.m. ET In a shake-up of the top ranks of U.S. national intelligence , President Trump announced Thursday that he will name Joseph Maguire , the current Director of the National Counterterrorism Center , as the nation 's acting top intelligence official . Trump made the announcement close on the heels of a tweet disclosing the resignation of the current deputy director of national intelligence , Sue Gordon . Her resignation takes effect on August 15 , the same day as that of outgoing Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats , which had already been announced . The director of national intelligence oversees the country 's civilian and military intelligence . On Maguire 's appointment , Trump tweeted : `` I am pleased to inform you that the Honorable Joseph Maguire , current Director of the National Counterterrorism Center , will be named Acting Director of National Intelligence , effective August 15th . Admiral Maguire has a long and distinguished ... career in the military , retiring from the U.S. Navy in 2010 . He commanded at every level , including the Naval Special Warfare Command . He has also served as a National Security Fellow at Harvard University . I have no doubt he will do a great job ! '' Trump praised Gordon in his initial tweet . `` Sue Gordon is a great professional with a long and distinguished career . I have gotten to know Sue over the past 2 years and have developed great respect for her . Sue has announced she will be leaving on August 15 , which ... coincides with the retirement of Dan Coats . A new Acting Director of National Intelligence will be named shortly . '' Trump initially intended to nominate Rep. John Ratcliffe , R-Texas , as the new DNI succeeding Coats . But Trump 's plan to nominate Ratcliffe ran into a bipartisan wall of opposition from lawmakers who questioned his expertise . The president dropped his intention to nominate Ratcliffe late last week complaining that the Texas lawmaker had been treated `` unfairly '' by the news media . Gordon was a career CIA officer who Trump said he could consider as acting DNI , something supporters argue was owed to her by the law . The New York Times had reported that Trump barred her from intelligence briefings in the Oval Office at least once . Publicly , Trump stated , `` I like Sue Gordon . '' In her letter of resignation , Gordon thanked the president `` for the opportunity to serve the Nation as the Principal Deputy Director of national Intelligence for the past two years . '' Gordon won praise from both the chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee . The chairman , Sen. Richard Burr , R-N.C. , called her resignation `` a significant loss for our Intelligence Community . '' `` In more than three decades of public service , Sue earned the respect and admiration of her colleagues with her patriotism and vision , '' Burr said in a statement . `` She has been a stalwart partner to the Senate Intelligence Committee , and I will miss her candor and deep knowledge of the issues . '' Sen. Mark Warner , D-Va . , the committee vice chairman , echoed those remarks in a series of tweets praising Gordon and suggesting that she was pushed out by Trump . `` The mission of the intelligence community is to speak truth to power , '' Warner wrote . `` Yet in pushing out two dedicated public servants in as many weeks , once again the President has shown that he has no problem prioritizing his political ego even if it comes at the expense of our national security . '' In a handwritten note to the president , Gordon made it clear she did not wish to leave her post . She wrote : `` I offer this letter as an act of respect & patriotism , not preference .

But those numbers , the subject of a recent column , paint a limited picture . Yes , we have neighborhoods struggling with poverty here -- and especially when you compare incomes to the West Side . But what those figures do n't show is the broader reality of what 's happened with income in Spokane over the past five years : It 's grown remarkably overall -- more than the rest of the county , the rest of the state and the rest of the nation . Think of it as the $ 14,700 difference . That 's how much the median household income has grown in the city of Spokane between 2013 and 2018 . During the same period , incomes nationwide grew by about $ 9,600 . `` Spokane kind of kicked ass and took names , '' said Gavin Cooley , the head dollars-and-cents guy at City Hall under two mayors . Furthermore , the most recent year -- between 2017 and 2018 -- was particularly strong , with median household incomes growing by 16 % . That 's a leap of more than $ 7,500 in one year . Patrick Jones , the executive director of the Institute for Public Policy and Economic Analysis at Eastern Washington University , referred to the recent income growth here as the best economic year in a generation . `` As a business owner friend told me , '' Jones wrote in an email , `` 2018 was a very good year . '' The recent income growth comes at a time of great progress and reason for positivity in the city , despite the gloomy nature of our noisy sky-is-falling political campaigns . Cooley sees the income growth as the single most important indicator of community health , bolstered in part by a variety of effective , efficient initiatives that emerged from the city government -- divided though it sometimes was -- of the past eight years . Innovative and money-saving infrastructure improvements . Continued progress on street fixes citywide . A revitalization of Riverfront Park . More cops on the streets . An incredible expansion of the park , plaza , trail and overlook access to the Spokane River , with the newest plaza in front of the library unveiled on Friday . Cooley sees it as a high point not unlike the Expo era . And he 's concerned that what followed that era was a sinking in the city 's fortunes -- as shown in incomes that did n't keep pace with the nation . For now , though , our numbers look better than they have in ages . Five years ago , Spokane 's median household income was 33 % lower than the national figure , according to a comparison of census figures Cooley provided . In 2018 , we lagged the nation by just 15 % . We 're now within hailing distance of the national median household income -- at $ 54,085 here , compared to just under $ 62,000 nationally . `` If we have five more years of growth , we 'll be above the national average , '' Cooley said . `` The last time we were on par with the U.S. was before Expo . '' Between 2013 and 2018 , the average annual rise in the median household income citywide was roughly twice the national increase -- 6.7 % a year in Spokane , compared to 3.5 % nationally . And , though the city still is dealing with higher-than-average poverty levels , the typical Spokane household has seen its income grow more than the county at large or Spokane Valley , and more than the robust statewide average , as well . Here are a few more statistics on income growth : The annual growth in median household income was 4.8 % in the county at large , 3.7 % in the Spokane Valley and 4.9 % statewide . Since 2005 , income has grown 56 % in the city , compared to 34 % nationally , 43 % in Spokane County and 50 % statewide . The increase in the median income over the most recent five-year period was $ 12,207 countywide , $ 8,574 in Spokane Valley and $ 15,668 statewide . It can be easy to forget -- or fail to notice in the first place -- what 's been happening in this city recently . It 's not a disaster . Not downtown , not citywide . Not by a long shot .", "date": "2019-10-27 00:00:00", "url": "http://spokesman.com/stories/2019/oct/27/shawn-vestal-head-here/", "phase": "E", "title": "Shawn Vestal : Recent income growth in Spokane outpaces state , nation", "names": [{"name": "shawn vestal", "ids": ["Q38235479"], "offsets": [[6, 8]]}, {"name": "patrick jones", "ids": ["Q19671843", "Q2057711", "Q28655295", "Q56166336", "Q7146858"], "offsets": [[237, 239], [283, 284]]}]}, {"articleID": "2019101418_00133161_W", "content": "Arizona Cardinals Stories Saquon Barkley , other injured Giants improving with Cardinals up next Share By Arizona Sports October 14 , 2019 at 11:18 am New York Giants ' Saquon Barkley celebrates his touchdown during the first half of an NFL football game against the Buffalo Bills , Sunday , Sept. 15 , 2019 , in East Rutherford , N.J.

Also under watch for concussion symptoms is running back Wayne Gallman , Barkley 's backup . Gallman did n't play last week . Instead , undrafted rookie Jon Hilliman took 11 carries for 38 yards Thursday in a 35-14 loss to the New England Patriots but fumbled once . He has since been cut . Over the weekend , New York signed former Ravens running back Buck Allen , who could potentially play depending on the availability of Barkley and Gallman . The Giants will be pleased if any of the injured offensive players can make a return . Jones went 15-of-31 for 161 yards , one touchdown and three interceptions last week against the Patriots . The sixth overall pick 's top target was veteran receiver Golden Tate , who caught six balls for 102 yards and a score . Rookie fifth-round pick Darius Slayton and tight end Rhett Ellison were the only other two Giants who received more than two targets . They each had three catches .

Joe Schmidt 's Ireland toppled back-to-back world champions New Zealand 16-9 at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday , for just their second-ever win over the All Blacks . Ireland 's players linked arms , and as New Zealand started their Haka , took one solitary step forward . Rory Best , left , and Joe Schmidt , right , have inspired Ireland 's two triumphs over New Zealand ( Brian Lawless/PA ) Leinster flanker Van Der Flier admitted the symbolism of that move geed Ireland up , helping the hosts stop New Zealand scoring against a Test nation for the first time since facing France in 1995 . Asked about the idea behind stepping towards the Haka , Van Der Flier replied : `` I think it just represented the fact we were n't going to take a backward step the whole game . `` That 's what Rory Best said to us , we wanted to go after them , not step away , not accept being bullied by them . `` That was part of it and then I suppose it 's a pretty special moment as a team all being together and watching something as historic as the Haka . So it 's quite cool . `` You watch any game New Zealand play , they are incredibly physical , so we knew we had to come out and go after them . `` We knew we could n't sit back , we went out to go after them and really put pressure on them .

The Ulster powerhouse capped a stunning Joe Schmidt ruse , collecting his own punt to dot down after Johnny Sexton 's cute switch with Bundee Aki . Rory Best produced a much-improved showing at hooker to sit alongside his Haka ruse , with Van Der Flier hailing the Ireland captain 's all-round leadership qualities . `` Rory understands players very well ; he 'll put his arm around you , but will also know if you need a good talking to , '' said Van Der Flier . Rory Best shone against New Zealand ( Paul Harding/PA ) `` But mostly he 's very softly spoken , but says exactly what needs to be said . `` He wo n't over-talk and he knows what 's best for the team , and always gives his all for the team . `` When you see the performances he puts out and how much effort he puts in every week , and how he trains and everything , he 's someone it 's a privilege to follow . `` He 's a massive competitor , incredibly competitive . And you see his work at the breakdown every week , he 's brilliant . He puts in a shift every time and does his all .

Travis Scott , Stormi , and Kylie Jenner The ` Keeping Up with the Kardashians ' star and the 28-year-old rapper split earlier this month but have remained amicable and have been a formidable duo when it comes to co-parenting their 20-month-old daughter . And during a trip to the immersive Halloween-themed jack-o ' - lantern experience Nights of the Jack on Thursday ( 17.10.19 ) , the pair were seen being `` extremely attentive '' to their tot . One onlooker told People magazine : '' [ Kylie and Travis ] were such a great team . They were very involved with Stormi , taking turns rolling her around in a pink , Ariel-themed stroller . They were extremely attentive and had their eyes on her at all times . '' The 22-year-old reality star and Travis were joined for the evening by Kylie 's sister Kourtney Kardashians , who also brought two of her three children , seven-year-old Penelope , and four-year-old Reign . Mason , nine , was not with them . Meanwhile , it was recently claimed Kylie is ready to start dating again , as she 's reportedly asked her friends to set her up with a new man .

At the event , another judge praised Edwin Cameron , loftily describing their workplace as a shrine to democracy but also ribbing the colleague he sees often . `` He has assured me and reassured me that he has no crush on me , '' joked Dikgang Moseneke , the deputy chief justice and a former activist who was jailed for years during white racist rule . The audience laughed , and laughed more when Cameron stepped to the microphone and said : `` I 'm actually blushing . '' The banter captured the ideal of openness in the South African court , anchor of a constitution widely seen as one of the most progressive in the world because of its commitment to equality , operating in an inevitably imperfect society that struggles to fulfill expectations 20 years after the end of white racist rule . Cameron 's own story as a man who publicly stated he has the virus that causes AIDS and later joined the nation 's highest court exemplifies the possibility of South Africa , in contrast with growing intolerance toward gays in Uganda , Nigeria and some other African countries . Many of the 11 judges on the Constitutional Court were activists in the fight against apartheid that culminated in the first all-race elections in 1994 , Cameron said in an interview in his office with The Associated Press . He worked as a human rights lawyer during the tumultuous last chapter of white rule and has campaigned for gay rights . `` You sit on a court with judicial capacities and judicial constraints , but you also have known injustice yourself and grown up and worked professionally in the acute awareness of it . So that 's what makes it different , '' Cameron said . He described South Africans as skeptical , outspoken and politicized , saying those qualities are the beneficial fallout of challenging apartheid for decades . `` We are not quiescent , '' said 61-year-old Cameron , who joined the Constitutional Court in 2009 . `` Unlike Zimbabwe , unlike Swaziland , it 's our angry population that is our safeguard against authoritarianism and dictatorship . I think that 's a tremendous plus . '' South Africa often deliberates to what extent past racial injustice hurts its ability to overcome crime , corruption , poverty and other challenges even as it boasts a stable electoral system and one of Africa 's biggest economies . The debate is intensifying ahead of ceremonies later this month for the 20th anniversary of the end of apartheid and elections in May . In `` Justice : A Personal Account , '' Cameron traces the hardship of his early life - his father in jail , a sister killed in a road accident , time spent in a children 's home - through a top education that only whites were entitled to , his discovery of the law as a way to repair a racially torn society and his own life , as well the 1986 discovery that he was HIV positive . He fell ill a decade later , but anti-retroviral treatment restored him and today he helps AIDS charities and children 's homes and is a passionate cyclist . Cameron 's upward journey illustrates the promise of South Africa 's constitutional law , influenced by codes in Germany , Canada , India , Namibia and elsewhere . South Africa is one of the few countries to guarantee the right to food , water , housing and other basics , though recent protests for government services indicate these are hard commitments to keep . `` The person on the public road burning tires to stop passing traffic because of service delivery protests feel they deserve more under the constitution , and they articulate it that way , '' Cameron said . `` There 's a fiery demand for government to improve itself , and in a paradoxical way , that is not a bad thing . '' In the book , he describes the court 's key 2002 ruling during the country 's AIDS epidemic that a reluctant government must make anti-retroviral drugs available . Cameron was part of a 2011 majority ruling that said a move to bring an elite crime-busting team under police supervision was unconstitutional because its independence would be compromised . The judge said he was worried about `` endemic , almost pervasive corruption '' in South Africa , the diminishing effectiveness of some state agencies and economic inequality , even though the middle class has grown . Cameron has an elegant manner , yet writes with blunt honesty . He describes childhood memories of urinating with his legs primly together , a habit he calls `` girlish '' and `` exactly right for me '' as his sexuality developed . In the AP interview , he said opening up has been a 30-year process , starting with his `` coming out '' as a gay and acknowledging , in a terrifying , liberating moment , that he was HIV positive in 1999 . He is , however , troubled by threats to homosexual rights elsewhere in Africa . Uganda and Nigeria recently passed laws strengthening criminal penalties against gay sex . `` There 's absolutely no doubt that the end of this is going to be a recognition that homosexuality is as African as it is human anywhere in the world , '' Cameron said . `` Whether that 's going to take another 20 years or 30 years or in my grieving moments , 40 years even , I do n't know .

'' Poor , destabilized , post-putsch Ukraine is to be congratulated for receiving something none of the 28 countries that actually belongs to the EU ever does : support for its sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity . ( `` Unity '' is a more complicated matter , given the EU 's reflexive pox on separatist movements that might prefigure the breakup of the EU itself . ) As the world 's pre-eminent transnational entity since the breakup of the USSR , the EU is all about eradicating its members ' sovereignty , independence and borders . This , of course , is not something most Americans are aware of . When we hear talk of `` Europe '' vs. Russia , or the importance of extending `` European values , '' most Americans typically envision our longtime allies as they used to be -- sovereign and independent within historical national borders . Their dedication to the democratically enshrined rights of their citizens as guaranteed for more than half a century , mainly by U.S. power , is beyond question . It should n't be . Anyone who thinks the bureaucratically grotesque and anti-democratic superstate model hit the junk heap of history with the USSR in 1991 needs to look more closely at the bureaucratically grotesque and anti-democratic Brussels monolith . For starters , the elected members of the European Parliament may not introduce legislation or even introduce the repeal of legislation . Instead , they may ( and frequently do ) rubber stamp legislation for their member-states -- much , as leading Soviet dissident leader Vladimir Bukovsky has pointed out , in the tradition of the old Supreme Soviet . All legislation and decision-making come from the unelected members of the EU 's executive body , the European Commission , which Bukovsky compares to the old Politburo . ( Some of the 28 EU commissioners are even former Communist apparatchiks . ) Little wonder Bukovsky has dubbed the EU the `` EUSSR . '' With co-author Pavel Stroilov , Bukovsky documented 1980s-era discussions between Western and Soviet leaders recorded in Soviet archives that foreshadow the rise of the collectivist European superstate in a 2004 booklet titled `` EUSSR : The Soviet Roots of European Integration .

The BBC has faced questions over impartiality -- given that same-sex marriage is a contentious political issue in the region -- since announcing staff in the organisation 's BBC Pride group would be attending Saturday 's event . A memo to workers issued last week said staff would be participating in the annual Pride parade wearing BBC-branded T-shirts . A statement also mentioned BBC Northern Ireland in the context of employees taking part . A day ahead of the event , BBC NI director Peter Johnston acknowledged there had been `` confusion '' about the `` terms and basis for BBC staff involvement in the Belfast Pride parade 2019 '' . He said while members of the BBC Pride staff network -- an employee-led initiative -- would be taking part , BBC NI as a corporate body would not . `` We know that there are legislative issues specific to Northern Ireland in relation to same-sex marriage , '' he said . `` These raise important considerations for the BBC in the context of its editorial guidelines , including the requirement to maintain due impartiality within our output . `` None of this means that members of the BBC Pride network can not be involved in Pride festivities in Belfast , but it does require BBC Northern Ireland to avoid creating the impression that it has a position on matters of political contention or controversy . Last year 's Belfast Pride saw thousands join the colourful procession ( PA ) `` The BBC 's editorial guidelines provide clear advice in this regard . It is on this basis that BBC NI will not be involved corporately in the Belfast Pride parade and that individual programme brands will not be represented . `` As , and if , wider circumstances change , we will keep all of this under review . And we will continue to report and provide a forum for debate about issues relating to same-sex marriage in ways that are fair , accurate and impartial . '' The ban on same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland is one of the key disputes at the heart of the region 's two-and-a-half year powersharing impasse . Mr Johnston added : `` Our fundamental commitment is to serving and reflecting the needs of all BBC audiences and to achieving that objective with a diverse workforce in which everyone is valued .

Trump is en route to the G-7 summit in France . Photo : Alex Brandon , AP Trump faces limits of go-it-alone stance at global summit 1 / 3 Back to Gallery BIARRITZ , France ( AP ) -- President Donald Trump heads into a summit with global economic powers confronting the consequences of his preference for going it alone in a polarized nation and an interconnected world . The Group of Seven nations are gathering in a French beach resort town at one of the most unpredictable moments in Trump 's tenure , with his public comments and decision-making increasingly erratic and acerbic of late . Trump , growing more isolated in Washington over his pugnacious ways , faces an even icier reception on the world stage , where a laundry list of geopolitical challenges awaits . Anxiety is growing over a global slowdown and new points of tension with allies are opening on trade , Iran and Russia . With fears of a financial downturn spreading , increasing the need for cooperation and collective response , Trump arrives Saturday having ridiculed Germany for its economic travails . But he may well need Angela Merkel and others to help blunt the force of China 's newly aggressive tariffs on U.S. goods . Before leaving Washington on Friday , Trump added fresh fuel to the raging trade war with China by declaring that U.S. businesses with dealings in China are `` hereby ordered '' to begin moving home . There was no immediate explanation of just what he expected or what authority he had to make it happen . He also slapped higher levels of tariffs on Chinese imports . `` Tariffs are working out very well for us , '' Trump told reporters as he departed the White House for France . `` People do n't understand that yet . '' The president earlier in the day made light of a sharp drop in the financial markets in reaction to his latest trade actions , with a tongue-in-cheek tweet speculating that the Dow 's plunge could be tied to the departure of a lower-tier candidate in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination . In recent days , Trump has sent mixed signals on a number of policy fronts . At one point , he moved to de-escalate the trade conflict in order to ease the impact on consumers during the holiday shopping season . At another , he flip-flopped on the need for tax cuts to stimulate an economy that Trump publicly insists is rocketing . Feeding Trump 's anxiety , aides say , is his realization that the economy -- the one sturdy pillar undergirding his bid for a second term -- is undeniably wobbly . Now the president who has long eschewed multilateralism hopes to use his time in Biarritz to rally global leaders around the need to do more to promote economic growth . Before arriving in France , he engineered a late change to the summit agenda , requesting a working session on global economic issues . For the world leaders , it was the latest example of unpredictability from Trump . After two-and-a-half years of Trump 's turbulent presidency , traditional American allies have come to expect the unexpected -- and increasingly look elsewhere for leadership . `` They have figured out how to deal with this president , '' said Jon Alterman , a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies . `` I think what we 're going to see out of this summit is , on the one hand , an effort by countries and the leaders to align with the president , but also an understanding that we 'll have to do more without the U.S. president . '' The annual G-7 summit has historically been used to highlight common ground among the world 's leading democracies . But in a bid to work around Trump 's impulsiveness , French President Emmanuel Macron has eschewed plans for a formal joint communique from this gathering . Last year 's summit , hosted by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau , ended in acrimony after Trump thought the prime minister had slighted the president after he had departed . Trump then tweeted insults at Trudeau from aboard Air Force One as he flew to a summit with North Korea 's Kim Jong Un and withdrew his signature from the statement of principles that all seven nations had agreed to . At his first G-7 summit in 2017 , Trump 's strong feelings against climate change roiled the gathering in Italy . Trump has made his `` America first '' priorities clear at every turn . At a recent campaign rally in New Hampshire , the crowd roared with approval when Trump declared : `` I 'm the President of the United States of America . I 'm not the president of the world . '' Addressing the global slowdown is n't the only pressing challenge that Trump has discovered requires multilateral action . For more than a year , his administration has struggled with persuading European leaders to repatriate captured fighters from the Islamic State . To date his entreaties have been met with deaf ears . Alterman and Heather Conley , the Europe expert at CSIS , both said Macron appeared to be trying to fill the void left by Trump on the world stage , noting the French leader 's recent efforts to try to reduce tensions between the U.S. and Iran . Many of the summit proceedings will take place behind closed doors , in intimate settings designed for the leaders to develop personal relationships with one another . Trump , White House aides said , is especially looking forward to his sit-down with new British Prime Minister Boris Johnson , the similarly brash pro-Brexit leader whose election he 'd backed . On the margins of the annual gathering , Trump has scheduled individual meetings with several of his counterparts , including Macron , Trudeau , Merkel , Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi . Also on the agenda will be the clashes between police and pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong ; Iran 's renewed nuclear enrichment and interference with shipping in the Strait of Hormuz ; and the Islamic State prisoners who are currently imprisoned by American-backed Kurdish forces in Syria . Increasingly fearful of an economic slowdown 's potential to diminish his 2020 electoral chances , Trump was expected to press his fellow leaders about what can be done to spur growth in the U.S. and abroad , as well as to open European , Japanese and Canadian markets to American manufacturers and producers . Trump has imposed or threatened to impose tariffs on all three markets in his pursuit of free , fair and reciprocal trade . It is unclear what substantive steps could be taken by the leaders to address the global slowdown , and much of that discussion stands to be dominated by disagreements on Trump 's trade policies . While on French soil , Trump also intends to raise with Macron and the other leaders the issue of a digital services tax that France has imposed on major technology companies like Google and Facebook despite Trump 's threats to slap back with retaliatory tariffs on French wine . The Trump administration says the tax targets and discriminates against U.S. businesses . As he headed for the France , the president got in a dig at the host nation , saying of the tax , `` It 's very unfair . And if they do that , we 'll be taxing their wine or doing something else .

And Ardern is downplaying the letter 's importance , saying the National Party is playing politics by making it a bigger deal than it is . Genter , the Associate Transport Minister and a Green MP , sent the letter to Transport Minister Phil Twyford in March before the local council voted to support its $ 6.4 billion transport package . Several Wellington city councillors have said they felt they were presented with a `` take it or leave it '' deal ahead of the council , saying Mayor Justin Lester told them Genter had threatened to resign over the project . Advertisement Advertise with NZME . Lester has denied this , while Genter has said she never threatened to resign . National has for weeks demanded the release of the letter amid speculation that Genter 's influence had seen a second Mt Victoria Tunnel put on the back burner in the Let 's Get Wellington Moving package . Meanwhile , a second Terrace tunnel and the trenching of Karo Drive did n't make the final cut at all .

The opening scene of the visual shows the vocalist staring at a burning old-school Cadillac set on fire . The picturesque film continues into the opening verse on owning up to intimate feelings and connections that could be conflicting or dangerous if pursued . `` I do n't wan na lead us in the wrong direction/Force or fake a feeling cause we both need affection/End up co-dependent cause we ca n't deal with depression/The way we need / So can we be real ? / About how this feels , '' he croons . `` With this first visual , I wanted to make sure to do something more striking and interesting than I 've ever done that makes you feel the isolation that is so felt in the music , '' he said in a statement . `` I think we did it with ` How This Feels , ' '' His widely successful single `` Frustrated '' reached Top 10 at Urban AC Radio in 2017 .

Cole , Ari Lennox , WoWGr8 of EarthGang ( above ) , Cozz ( below ) , JID , Bas ( standing ) , Olu of EarthGang ( kneeling ) - pose for a photo from the Return of the Dreamers 3 sessions at Tree Sound Studios in Atlanta , Ga. . Jonathan Mannion / Courtesy of Interscope Records Revenge of the Dreamers III : The Top Seven Artists Who Stood Out The much-awaited Revenge of the Dreamers III compilation album was released this past Friday ( July 5 ) , and it exceeded all expectations , and then some . The first two records of the trilogy predominantly featured Dreamville acts , and their in-house producers . However , this time J. Cole 's label shed their reputation of sectioning themselves off from the rest of the industry and embraced artists and producers from outside of their circle . The melodic , often raspy , only occasionally recognizable voices of the 32 rappers and singers featured on the 18-track album , echo throughout the project . As was expected , J. Cole spit lots of great verses , but the the other emcees certainly were n't masked by his shadow . In fact , Cole gave ample room for the young bloods on ROTD3 to showcase their clever lines , their vocal range , and their artistry as a whole . While it was hard to narrow down which artists on ROTD3 were the best , there are several on the project who stood out and earbed than a couple of rounds of applause . The five have yet to achieve chart-topping status , but after their performance on ROTD3 , that achievement is n't far away . 1 . Buddy Buddy proclaimed himself the `` Rap Camp MVP , '' and his praise was validated by the Dreamville documentary and the record itself . The 25-year-old 's valley voice can be heard on three songs off the project and he was unlike anyone else , bringing an eccentric vibe to the songs he was featured on . In fact , Buddy 's one of the best parts on the album 's standout song , `` 1993 '' and he did n't even rap on it . Hearing Buddy playfully cut off and hound Smino , Cozz , Doctur Dot ( EarthGang ) , J.I.D and Cole himself , so they could focus on more important things such as smoking weed , brought a carefree element to ROTD3 . Some may not expect such jovial vibes from the usually thoughtful Dreamville camp . Like Cole said , Buddy is `` a real life legend . '' 2 . J.I. D J.I.D. is quickly becoming one of Dreamville 's most recognizable acts , and it 's easy to see why he was featured on five different songs on the album , more than any other artist on ROTD3 aside from Cole . He represented his hometown of Atlanta effortlessly , especially on the lead-up single `` Down Bad , '' where his voice -- unique as ever -- uplifts the chorus . He 's hard to keep up with and he 's always quick with his rhymes , but there 's no reason why J.I.D should have to slow down . With a style similar to Kendrick Lamar 's , J.I. D 's destination to the top is inevitable , and the quicker he gets there , the better . After all , who else could have came up with the bars : `` I was just f *** ed up , I was just down , down bad/I had to tighten the f ** k up , but I 'm here for the crown/Board of Education vs. Brown/I was bored of education , left the town/F ** k a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and f ** k a cap and gown/F ** k a background check back ' round when I get the check/N *** a , that 's now . '' 3 . J. Cole Dreamville founder J. Cole always carries high expectations with him , and he showed out with his seven appearances - more than any other artist - on ROTD3 . The project saw Cole working differently from usual , but he displayed adaptability and flourished outside of his comfort zone . On `` 1993 , '' fans hear a version of Cole that he often keeps hidden -- a fun , wild side that keeps up with the the carefree energy of the younger rappers on the track . For those other listeners who were itching to hear old school Cole from his Born Sinner days , he brought that out on the song `` Sacrifices . '' Sure , the North Carolina native can be the butt of Twitter memes -- but who else can go platinum with no features -- but every time he shows up , he shows out and shows the rap industry why Dreamville is such a force . 4 . EarthGang Doctur Dot and Johnny Venus are two most versatile rappers on ROTD3 , and together they form one of the most formidable groups in hip hop . While their verses are crafty , it 's not so much their rhymes that command a song , but rather the way they play with and control their voices . Both Doctur Dot and Johnny Venus have a talent for manipulating the tone and range of their vocal chords , and that is especially evident in `` Swivel , '' their song on the album . They bring a unique sense of quirkiness to each appearance , and when they link up with the equally unconventional Buddy or Smino , magic happens . 5 . Guapdad4000 Guapdad4000 is largely known for his hilarious viral social media videos or for his songs about scamming , but he took Revenge of the Dreamers III as an opportunity to show off his musical talents at a high level . He told VIBE , `` I felt that I was n't going to go down there and outrap the super rap rap ni ** as , even though talent-wise , I am a super rap rap ni ** a. ... My plan was to just be true to myself , let my tone carry . '' The Oakland artist does exactly that , turning in two of the best choruses on the album with `` Do n't Hit Me Right Now '' and `` Costa Rica . '' His airy vocals and catchy , earworm hooks hold together the songs he appears on . And he also briefly bars up on `` Wells Fargo . '' Guapdad4000 is hilarious , but his skills are nothing to joke about . 6 . Cozz Cozz is Dreamville 's youngest member at 25 years old , joining the label in 2014 and reintroducing himself to the world on ROTD3 . Although he has two projects already released under Dreamville , this is without a doubt the biggest `` stage '' he 's ever been on and he took advantage of it . The Los Angeles native was bold on this album with his record featuring Top Dawg Entertainment artist , Reason , called `` LamboTruck '' and speaks to his artistry . He 's a risk taker , a big one at that given the fact that the Kal Banx-produced song is him expressing a few frustrations he has with his label . Every bar Cozz let off on the track was crafty and clever , which is definitely a strength of his , and as a listener it was entertaining figuring out the underlying meaning . Cozz is not one to be slept on , and it 's about time is welcomed into the new class of young rappers . 6 . Ari Lennox Lately touted as the `` First Lady of Dreamville , '' Ari Lennox can always be counted on to bring heart and soul to any project she touches . Her syrupy , raspy voice was the perfect touch to ROTD3 to make it whole and her heartfelt lyrics were the cherry on top . On `` Got Me , '' which was a single released prior to the album 's drop date , fans can hear the DMV songstress harmonize effortlessly with features king , Ty Dolla $ ign . `` Self Love '' is a relatable ballad that strikes a chord with people every time Lennox croons , `` self love is the best drug/but your love is the worst drug . '' With her own debut album Shea Butter Baby already making big waves this year , plus her features on ROTD3 , Lennox is taking the R&B world by storm , and she 'll let it rain on anyone who lets her . Young Thug And Mason Ramsey Hop On Second ` Old Town Road ' Remix Young Thug is one of two high-profile names to hop on Lil Nas X 's `` Old Town Road . '' The Atlanta artist joins the chart-topping 20-year-old , Billy Ray Cyrus and Mason Ramsey ( affectionately known as the `` Yodeling Kid '' ) for the song 's second remix . The My T.H.U.G. Story rapper has been keeping relatively busy in 2019 . In May , Thugger dropped `` The London '' featuring J. Cole and Travis Scott . It was initially teased during Miami 's edition of the Rolling Loud Festival , where flyers were released teasing a `` summer anthem . '' The original remix featuring the `` Achy Breaky Heart '' musician recently earned an RIAA Diamond status , and has sat atop the Billboard Hot 100 for 14 consecutive weeks . It is one of only a handful of songs to achieve this feat , and it 's getting closer to being the longest-running No. 1 song in history .

'' `` this is a horrible day and there 's no other way to put it , '' said tabaka 's attorney michael undem . the two 31-year-olds were riding on tabaka 's atv when the four-wheeler slid around a curve in the paul bunyan state forest and crashed headlong into a tree . christopherson , a benedict resident , died at the scene . tabaka , a walker resident , asked for christopherson 's family to forgive him . he acknowledged he 's been going to counseling for depression caused by the accident and thinks of the mishap every day . `` i 'm working on changing my life , '' he said , `` to help people instead of hurt people . to me , i have to make amends any way i can . '' tabaka was legally drunk and driving too fast for the slippery , muddy road conditions , the criminal complaint said . `` chad , it is time for you to grow up and smarten up , '' said christopherson 's maternal uncle gary gehrke . tabaka pled guilty last month to criminal vehicular homicide , a felony punishable by a maximum of 10 years in jail and/or a $ 20,000 fine . instead he will serve a year in the hubbard county jail followed by a year of electronic home monitoring with an alcohol sensor . he will be on probation 10 years , during which time he can not use alcohol or drugs , go to bars and must submit to random alcohol testing . he must perform 500 hours of community service and make restitution to christopherson 's heirs . in actuality , tabaka received a 57-month sentence stayed for the duration of his probation . he will be eligible for work release during his jail time . `` the sentence is still hanging over his head , '' said hubbard county attorney don dearstyne . it will be imposed if tabaka violates his probation terms . `` this is not the end of your life , '' judge john smith told the defendant . `` it 's the beginning of a better life . '' but smith warned , `` if i see you again it will be a sad day for you . '' smith upped the 48-month sentence both undem and dearstyne had requested . `` i made this upward departure because you were given a break on the disposition , '' the judge noted . but he said justice contains `` an element of mercy even for those who have committed wrong . '' if tabaka violates any portion of his probation , he could spend the 57 months in state prison , not a local jail . undem said tabaka had grown up in an environment `` where alcohol was prevalent '' at every gathering . the day of the accident , all the friends four-wheeling had been drinking much of the time , he said . christopherson 's aunt shelli johnson laid photos of the victim 's three daughters on smith 's bench . `` this is the family chad tabaka destroyed , '' johnson told the judge . she wept as she told the court all three daughters had been separated . two went to live with fathers they 'd never known . `` three sisters lost their mom and each other , '' she said . christopherson 's younger sister brianne said when she learned of the accident , `` my life shattered to pieces . '' she said the pain of living another 50 or 60 years without her only sister was unbearable . she urged tabaka to `` share a story with young adults '' about drinking and driving `` and maybe save a life . '' johnson and gehrke attended the plea hearing last month and strongly objected , saying it was too lenient . smith told the attorneys after that hearing if the family did n't unanimously support the deal , he would scuttle it . johnson and gehrke were permitted to look through the county attorney 's file and dearstyne spent time with them explaining the state 's sentencing guidelines and which prior convictions could be used against tabaka . they ultimately agreed with the plea bargain and voiced their approval monday on the witness stand . only a fraction of tabaka 's dismal driving record could be considered in sentencing due to a 10-year time bar , dearstyne told the family . tabaka has incurred 20 traffic and liquor-related infractions in three counties since 1997 . `` we could have filled this courthouse with all the people who love jess , '' johnson said . the family chose not to bring christopherson 's mother and grandparents to the hearing monday . `` they 'd be screaming for justice , '' johnson said , urging courtroom spectators to change the state 's drunken driving laws to make them more accountable in situations such as this . smith praised the county attorney and law enforcement for reconciling the case in the plea deal . `` it takes a lot of courage '' to take such steps , smith said . `` mr. tabaka , you have a great debt to pay , '' the judge admonished the defendant . `` you could be going to prison today . you got a break .

'' `` I did n't watch TV and go , ' I should act more like her , ' '' she added . `` I just did what came naturally to me and was just myself . '' In fact , she attributes her success to being unique and original . `` I think that 's why I 've had a long career in this , '' she explained . `` Because I was unlike anyone else . '' 2 - Today 's weaknesses are tomorrow 's strengths Giuliana Rancic Giuliana Rancic is pictured in this undated photo . Rancic jumped in `` GMA 's '' time machine and went even further back to a childhood photo of her shortly after she moved to the United States from Italy . `` '' I think it 's really easy , especially as a young girl , to focus on your weaknesses and think that they are going to affect you for the rest of your life . But if just take it one step further and realize what makes you weak today will actually be your strength tomorrow . - Giuliana Rancic `` When we first moved to America , I did n't speak any English at all , '' she said of moving to the states when she was just seven years old . `` So , I would just kind of be in the back of the classroom all alone , trying to adapt to a brand new place . It was really hard to make friends and that sort of thing . '' But she was able to turn this difficult language barrier into a strength . `` I think it 's really easy , especially as a young girl , to focus on your weaknesses and think that they are going to affect you for the rest of your life , '' she said . `` But if just take it one step further and realize what makes you weak today will actually be your strength tomorrow . '' As seen in her interviewing style today , Rancic said because she found it hard to break through that language barrier as a young girl , she made it her goal to eventually become a `` great communicator . '' `` And therefore , here I am , on the red carpet , interviewing people for a living , '' she added . 3 - Always appreciate the good things in life Giuliana Rancic Giuliana Rancic is pictured in this undated photo with her husband Bill Rancic . `` This was obviously a really difficult time in my life , '' Rancic said of a photo with her husband Bill during her breast cancer battle in 2011 . `` I was 36 years old and had just been told I had breast cancer . '' Rancic said the diagnosis was `` the shock of a lifetime , '' because she had no family history of the disease and was always a very healthy person . `` I found myself in this position a lot , '' she said of the picture . `` In a robe in the hospital , with Bill by my side . I just ca n't imagine what I would have done without Bill by my side . It was very , very important to still appreciate the good things in my life . '' Rancic admits that it would have been easy to `` be in a dark place all the time '' because of her health . `` I think what snapped me out of it a bunch of times a day was ` Yeah , this is bad , but guess what 's really good ? ' and Bill was definitely at the top of the good list , '' she said . 4 - Make a road map for your life Giuliana Rancic Giuliana Rancic is pictured in this undated photo , with her mother , on her graduation day . `` This is a picture of me and my mom at my college graduation when I graduated from the University of Maryland , '' she explained in this 20-year-old throwback . But though the picture was a time to celebrate a major life moment , Rancic had a major surgery about five or six months prior to her graduation . `` I had scoliosis for most of my life , '' she said . `` Senior year of college , my scoliosis got really bad and the doctors were like , ` You need surgery in the next month . ' '' With two rods in her back and in intense pain , Rancic accomplished her goal to graduate anyway . No matter what it took , she was sticking to her goal to graduate in the spring with her class . `` I did it and quite honestly I was proud of myself , '' she added . `` I had overcome this surgery in this time in my life . '' 5 - Actions really do speak louder than words Giuliana Rancic Giuliana Rancic is pictured in this undated photo with her husband Bill Rancic . `` So cute ! '' she gushed about a picture of her husband Bill kissing their son Duke . `` Hopefully when I look back on my life , these will be like my most precious memories , just being with family . '' Rancic said her parents led by example and that 's exactly what she does with her son . `` We do n't tell him what a good relationship is , we do n't tell him what respect is , we show him , '' she said . `` I still get butterflies with Bill . I still feel like it 's young love , even though we 've been together 13 years now . '' Bill is Giuliana 's best friend and that 's what they want to instill on their son and the world really . `` We are kind to everyone we meet , we are all humans , we all have feelings and we all deserve respect , '' she said . `` If we can teach him that then we 've succeeded .

Public sentiment has been turning sharply against Donald Trump as the government shutdown stretched on beyond its third week , and even one of the most Trump-friendly cable news outlets is no longer giving the president any cover . This week , Fox News published an op-ed on the front page of its website claiming that Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi are schooling Trump when it comes to the shutdown and that the public has turned against the president . Written by Leslie Marshall , the story noted that most Americas seem to agree with the Democrats that Trump 's border wall would be an ineffective way to combat illegal immigration and address border security . Marshall needled Trump even more by pointing out that Pelosi , one of his main adversaries , is more popular with voters than he is at this point . `` While most voters believe there is a border crisis , they do n't feel Trump 's border wall will solve the problem , echoing the sentiments of the Democratic leadership , '' she wrote . `` Add in that Trump 's approval ratings stand at 41 percent , the lowest since September , while his disapproval rating is 54 percent , the highest it 's been since September . Plus the fact that for the first time in his presidency , he is less popular than Nancy Pelosi , his main adversary . '' The shutdown began just before Christmas after Trump rejected a bipartisan funding measure and insisted that Congress provide funding for the border wall . Democrats have remained steadfast in their stance not to offer any funding , and the shutdown has become the longest in American history . With the shutdown keeping more than 800,000 federal employees out of work and out of a paycheck , public opinion polls show that the majority of Americans blame Trump , and that number is growing . A recent poll from the Washington Post/ABC News found that 53 percent of respondents blamed Trump and Republicans , while another from CBS News / YouGov poll found that 47 percent blamed Trump , and a CNN poll found that 55 percent blamed Donald Trump for the shutdown . President Trump has insisted that he is not going to compromise with Democrats to end the government shutdown , and that he is comfortable in his unbendable position . But privately , it 's sometimes a different story . https://t.co/v4dLdtLwxm -- Khashoggi 's Ghost ( @UROCKlive1 ) January 17 , 2019 Donald Trump may have himself to blame for the public sentiment . In the days before the shutdown began , he said during a televised meeting with Democratic leaders that he would `` proudly '' shut down the government in his demand for border wall funding and that he alone would take the blame . Trump quickly shifted away from that position , taking to Twitter to lay blame at the feet of Democrats , but the majority of Americans do not agree .", "date": "2019-01-17 02:56:53", "url": "http://feeds.inquisitr.com/~r/google/yDYq/~3/kiwmalcB6ro/", "phase": "E", "title": "Even Trump-Friendly ` Fox News ' Now Saying Chuck Schumer And Nancy Pelosi Are Schooling Trump During Shutdown Nathan Francis", "names": [{"name": "president trump", "ids": ["Q22686"], "offsets": [[8, 9], [80, 81], [115, 116], [135, 136], [177, 178], [202, 203], [264, 265], [333, 334], [356, 357], [373, 374], [391, 392], [496, 497]]}, {"name": "donald trump", "ids": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"], "offsets": [[22, 24], [384, 386], [441, 443]]}, {"name": "chuck schumer", "ids": ["Q380900"], "offsets": [[73, 75]]}, {"name": "nancy pelosi", "ids": ["Q170581"], "offsets": [[76, 78], [142, 143], [249, 251]]}, {"name": "leslie marshall", "ids": ["Q27996208", "Q6531003"], "offsets": [[99, 101], [133, 134]]}]}, {"articleID": "2009061513_00086393_W", "content": "emergency medicine physician-central florida-wuesthoff health system phoenix physicians , llc - ft lauderdale , fl phoenix physicians , llc - ft lauderdale , fl delivery mechanisms for large molecule drugs : successes and failures of leading technologies and key drivers for market success the cardiovascular market outlook to 2013 : competitive landscape , global market analysis and pipeline analysis is the leading source of healthcare it news with a special focus on cpoe , emr adoption making the right long-term prescription for medical equipment financing wall street journal , national coordinator for health it dr. david blumenthal details the benefits of health it and electronic health records , as well as the potential for the health it industry in the coming years . `` there are disputes about how much we 'll save and how we 'll show the benefits of health it , '' blumenthal said . `` the combination of an improved payment system , an improved education system about health it and improved governance of the healthcare system that prioritizes quality and efficiency together with health information technology is where the real payoff is .

In a tribute to the iconic Australian sporting event , the sweatband panels will be on-display in the lead-up and throughout the tournament at four locations in Melbourne , including two at Southern Cross Station , one at the busy corner of Flinders and Swanston streets , and one at Batman Avenue , close to the Open 's Melbourne Park hub . The sweatbands , which are made of towelling material with the Australian Open logo embroidered on them , have been attached to Australian Open ads via custom clamping , designed to keep them in place for the entirety of the campaign and not obscure the panels . They have also been weather-proofed to ensure they stand up to Melbourne 's notorious `` four seasons in one day '' weather patterns . Tennis Australia Chief Marketing and Insights Officer , Josie Brown , said : `` The Australian Open is known globally as the ` happy slam ' and we wanted to find a way to demonstrate our playful personality to everyone in the city of Melbourne . We hope this fun outdoor installation raises a smile and encourages people to get involved in the summer of tennis . '' JCDecaux Head of Creative Solutions , Ashley Taylor , said : `` We really wanted to create something memorable for commuters , and something that would play directly into the personality of this great tournament .

Also Read : Frank Lampard refuses to rule out a move for Edinson Cavani Cavani 's move to Chelsea under threat The Blues have been monitoring the Uruguay international as a potential signing for the January transfer window as they aim to take the pressure off of Tammy Abraham for the remainder of the season . The west London giants have been suffering from inconsistent performances in the final third with their latest game against Newcastle United a prime example of their attacking form . Cavani 's contract with PSG is scheduled to expire at the end of the campaign and he has already informed the Ligue 1 giants of his desire to leave by submitting a transfer request . Frank Lampard himself was all praise for the striker in a press conference on Monday saying , `` He 's ( Cavani ) a great player - I played against him and I always loved his mentality and his attitude . His goal-scoring record speaks for itself . I 'm not absolutely aware of what the situation is , so we 'll see . `` He 's an experienced player but so are many other players out there ! We are young as a squad so the idea of bringing in experience is not something I 'm looking away from . Sometimes the younger players need a bit of help . '' Frank Lamparde According to The Standard , Chelsea 's pursuit of Cavani could , however , be threatened as he is refusing to take a wage cut from his current salary in the event of a transfer .

According to a Seminole County Sheriff 's Office incident report , 14 year old Curtis Leonard was called to the discipline office on Thursday for an unrelated incident . When he he opened his backpack , that 's when an administrator noticed a gun and notified a deputy . Deputies say the chamber was loaded , but the gun was disassembled . Leonard now faces a felony charge of possession of a firearm of school property and was taken to the Juvenile Assessment Center . This is the second incident within the last year where a student managed to sneak a gun onto the campus . Following this incident , school leaders say another situation happened on Friday where students came forward and accused a 15 year old student of carrying a weapon on school grounds . They say 15 year old Bernard Blackmon was located with a 7 inch fishing knife and was arrested . The arrest report shows Blackmon has also been charged with possession of a weapon on school property . In response of these incidents , school leaders say that they are testing new technology as part of a pilot program which acts similar to metal detectors , but can be used in more places . They also want to remind students to report any suspicious activities by calling the SpeakOut hotline at 800-423-8477 or use their campus app . ` Take care of it ' : NC sheriff accused of plotting murder of deputy over tape of racist talk A North Carolina sheriff stands accused of urging the murder of a former deputy who had a recording of him using racially offensive language , authorities say . Granville County Sheriff Brindell Wilkins was indicted Monday on two counts of felony obstruction of justice , according to court records . Wilkins is accused of trying to get another man to kill former Deputy Joshua Freeman , who he believed was going to expose his racist talk . > > Read more trending news Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman , who is prosecuting the case , said Wilkins ' Aug. 12 , 2014 , phone conversation with the ` well-known ' man who threatened Joshua Freeman 's life was caught on tape , according to The News & Observer in Raleigh . Lorrin Freeman and Joshua Freeman are not related . Joshua Freeman worked for the Sheriff 's Office from November 2011 to August 2014 but was let go in the days leading up to Wilkins ' alleged crimes , WRAL in Raleigh reported . Wilkins , who was reelected in 2018 for a third four-year term , is accused of advising the unnamed man to kill Joshua Freeman , ` whom the defendant knew to have expressed his intention to soon publicly reveal a purported audio recording of the sheriff using racially offensive language to authorities in Raleigh , ' the indictment states . The court records do not detail what Wilkins is alleged to have said , or what ultimately happened to the recording of his words . The indictment against the sheriff alleges Wilkins encouraged the man to ` take care of it ' and said , ` The only way you gon na stop him is kill him . ' According to the indictment , Wilkins counseled the would-be gunman on how to kill Joshua Freeman in a way to avoid getting caught . He offered two tips , according to the document : Get rid of the murder weapon and keep quiet . ` You ai n't got the weapon , you ai n't got nothing to go on , ' Wilkins allegedly told the man , the court records allege . ` The only way we find out these murder things is people talk . You ca n't tell nobody nothin ' , not a thing . ' Wilkins and the individual discussed a time in which to kill Joshua Freeman and a location that would ensure it would be Wilkins ' own Granville County Sheriff 's Office investigators who would get the case , the indictment says . Wilkins assured the man he would not tell investigators of his prior knowledge of the crime . The indictment accuses Wilkins of failing to prevent harm to Joshua Freeman or warn him of the ` credible threat ' to his life . It alleges the sheriff also failed to seize the gun the other man planned to use , despite the person showing him the weapon at one point . ` The defendant failed to properly execute his duties because of his personal animosity towards Joshua Freeman , ' the indictment states . Joshua Freeman was never harmed , though the indictment offers no indication why the alleged plot failed . Wilkins went before a magistrate Monday and was released on $ 20,000 unsecured bond . Court records show he was ordered to have no contact with anyone named in the indictment . He was also ordered to surrender his passport , if he has one . Read the indictment against Granville County Sheriff Brindell Wilkins below . Brindell Wilkins Indictment by National Content Desk on Scribd ` No one is above the law , ' Lorrin Freeman said Monday , according to WRAL . ` It is always painful when someone who has the public trust faces these types of allegations for voters who put them in that place . ` Any time you have someone who is sworn to uphold the public trust , to protect their community , to investigate and report crimes , allegedly engage in this type of conduct , it is something that needs to be brought to justice , and so we will continue to follow the evidence in this case . ' Several followers of Wilkins ' public Facebook page offered support in the wake of the indictment . ` You will always have our support , ' one woman wrote . ` Praying for you and your family . ' ` Our friendship goes back 30 years or more and you have always been a great friend to me , ' another woman wrote . ` You were there for me many times . I believe in you and you have my support , always . ' Lorrin Freeman said Wake County is handling the case because Mike Waters , her counterpart in Granville County , could potentially become an important witness at trial . Waters , who addressed the case in a statement on his office 's Facebook page , wrote to Lorrin Freeman in November to ask her to look into the case . Watch Wake County DA Lorrin Freeman discuss the case below , courtesy of the News & Observer . WRAL reported that Joshua Freeman , who Waters represented in 2014 while in private practice , gave the future prosecutor the tape recording of Wilkins ' conversation with the man who talked of killing the former deputy . It was not clear Friday how Freeman obtained the recording . Waters said he immediately turned the tape over to the FBI . The Washington Post reported that Waters met with North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation agents about the recording in January 2017 , but nothing happened . ` Quite frankly , it did not get to the top of their investigative list , ' Lorrin Freeman told WRAL about SBI agents . Waters gave the recording to a different SBI agent in October 2018 , but still , no investigation was initiated , the Post reported . That is when Waters turned to Lorrin Freeman to initiate a probe into the sheriff . She agreed . ' I have reviewed this recording , ' Lorrin Freeman wrote to SBI agents , according to the Post . ` It contains a conversation between two individuals , one of whom appears to be the Granville County sheriff , about a former deputy sheriff and culminates in a discussion about committing a homicide . ' In his Facebook statement , Waters expressed frustration at the amount of time it took to get an investigation going . ` At all times since ( turning over the recording ) , I have provided assistance to investigators , and once Ms. Freeman opened a criminal investigation , have urged that this matter be given investigative priority , ' Waters wrote . ' I understand it is a matter of great importance to the people of Granville County , and it has been a point of frustration that the investigative process has not been more expeditious . ' He wrote that any allegations of wrongdoing by law enforcement are troubling , particularly when they involve a sheriff elected by the community . ` Over the next few months , my office will continue to lend assistance to the ongoing investigation as requested , while we continue to do our daily work of protecting victims , prosecuting those who violate the law and seeing that justice is administered , ' Waters said . WRAL reported Lorrin Freeman said she worked to obtain obstruction charges against Wilkins because obstruction would be easier to prove in the five-year old case than solicitation of murder or conspiracy . The Granville County Board of Commissioners met Tuesday to discuss the indictment , but County Attorney Jim Wrenn said the board has no authority to remove Wilkins , an elected official , from office as his criminal case winds its way through the court system , WRAL reported . Lorrin Freeman confirmed that fact to the News & Observer . ` Technically , he can continue to serve if he chooses , until convicted , ' Freeman told the newspaper . Spectrum News ' Charlotte bureau reported that Wilkins has indicated he will not step down . Wrenn said he is considering trying to get Wilkins out of office through the courts but wants to hear the recording himself before making that decision . Gerry Cohen , former special counsel to the North Carolina General Assembly , said state law has a provision allowing a judge to suspend a sheriff and allow a county commission to appoint a temporary replacement pending the outcome of a criminal case . ` The statute is there to allow removal of sheriff , ' Cohen told Spectrum News . ` One of six causes is , in fact , conviction of felony . Others are some of the things in his indictment , like willful misconduct , corruption , willful neglect or refusal to perform duties of his office . Some of them match the charges in his indictment . ' The News & Observer reported that the probe into Wilkins ' alleged actions against Joshua Freeman has led to investigations of the Granville County Sheriff 's Office 's accounting practices , as well as the operations of its drug unit . Freeman was a member of the drug unit when he was with the agency . ` Part of this investigation has centered on why this sort of conversation would have occurred , what the underlying motivation would have been , ' Lorrin Freeman said Tuesday , according to the newspaper . ` Additional information has come to light regarding operations and accounting practices of the Granville County narcotics interdiction team . ' Those investigations remain ongoing . In response to whistleblower complaint , Biden asks Trump in statement to release call transcript President Donald Trump called reports that a U.S. intelligence official filed a whistleblower complaint against him last month ' a ridiculous story ' while speaking Friday to reporters in the Oval Office . > > Read more trending news According to the Washington Post , the president made an unspecified ` promise ' to an unidentified foreign leader that concerned the intelligence official . The official filed a complaint Aug. 12 , two anonymous former U.S. officials told the newspaper , though lawmakers said Thursday they had yet to see the complaint . The intelligence community 's inspector general , Michael Atkinson , appeared before the House Intelligence Committee behind closed doors Thursday but declined , under administration orders , to reveal the substance of the complaint . Update 7:40 p.m. EDT Sept. 20 : Former Vice President Joe Biden has released a statement on the whistleblower 's complaint against President Trump . In it , Biden describes Trump 's alleged behavior as ` abhorrent ' and calls on him to release a full transcript of the call ` so that the American people can be judged for themselves . ' The entire statement reads : Update 4:40 p.m. EDT Sept 20 : The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the son of Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden , citing unidentified people familiar with the matter . The Journal reported Trump asked Zelensky to work with Rudy Giuliani to determine whether Biden ` worked to shield from investigation a Ukrainian gas company with ties to his son , Hunter Biden . ' Trump made the request about eight times during a phone call in July , according to the Journal . Trump was asked Friday if be brought up Biden in the call with Zelenskiy , and he answered , ` It does n't matter what I discussed . ' But then he used the moment to urge the media ` to look into ' Biden 's background with Ukraine . Trump and Zelenskiy are to meet on the sidelines of the United Nations next week . Update 1 p.m. EDT Sept. 20 : President Donald Trump told reporters Friday that the person behind the complaint filed against him was a ` partisan whistleblower ' who ` should n't even have information , ' though he added that he did not know the person 's identity . ' I do n't even know exactly who you 're talking about , ' Trump said . ' I do n't know the identity of the whistleblower . I just hear it 's a partisan person , meaning it comes out from another party . ' Trump said Friday that he 's spoken with several world leaders and that his conversations with them were ` always appropriate . ' Details surrounding the complaint remained unclear Friday afternoon , though The Washington Post and The New York Times reported at least some of the allegations centered on Ukraine . Both newspapers cited unidentified sources . Asked if he knew if the whistleblower 's complaint centered on a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky , the president responded ' I really do n't know ' but continued to insist any phone call he made with a head of state was ` perfectly fine and respectful . ' Update 9:50 p.m. EDT Sept. 19 : The whistleblower complaint against Donald Trump centers around Ukraine , two anonymous sources confirmed to The Washington Post Thursday evening .

However , Trump spoke on the phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky two and a half weeks before the complaint was filed , the Post reported .

' He said lawmakers had yet to see the complaint by Thursday afternoon . ` We do not know whether press reports are accurate or inaccurate about the contents of the complaint , ' he said . Earlier Thursday , the president denied having done anything inappropriate . Update 1 p.m. EDT Sept. 19 : Trump on Thursday denied any wrongdoing after reports claimed a whistleblower had come forward with a complaint about the president making an unspecified promise to a foreign leader . ` Another Fake News story out there - it never ends ! ' Trump wrote Thursday in a tweet . ` Virtually anytime I speak on the phone to a foreign leader , I understand that there may be many people listening from various U.S. agencies , not to mention those from the other country itself . ` Knowing all of this , is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially ` heavily populated ' call . I would only do what is right anyway , and only do good for the USA ! ' Original report : The promise occurred during a phone conversation with the leader , one source told the Post . Details about the alleged pledge and the leader 's identity was not immediately available . Although Michael Atkinson , the intelligence community 's inspector general , believed that the whistleblower complaint warranted ` urgent concern , ' acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire so far has declined to provide information about the communication to the House Intelligence Committee , the Post reported .

But under federal law , California had the right to ask for a waiver to permit tighter emission controls on new cars - and the state had been doing so for nearly 50 years . A number of others states had joined in accepting those same requirements . The Trump Administration argues there should only be a single national standard for emissions and gas mileage . The change by the feds ` will insure there is one - and only one - set of national fuel economy standards , as Congress mandated and intended , ' said Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao on Thursday .

Send me a copy : Zee group 's Subhash Chandra gives personal guarantee to mutual funds The Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) has shot a six-point letter to mutual funds ( MFs ) to ensure that unitholders ' interests are not getting compromised due to rise ` complex ' debt investments of MFs to promoter entities . The regulator has directed the MF trustees , `` To review the risk management policy of the MF including the aspects like cap on such exposure ( exposure to promoter entities ) , adequate cover , legal risk , market risk , liquidity risk , etc. to ascertain that the interest of unitholders are protected at all points of time . '' According to industry sources , Sebi also wants to assess if MFs have taken high-levels of exposures to promoters , which have already pledged a large part of their shares . `` Promoters with excess pledging would have limited ability to pledge additional shares to restore equity cover in case of sharp price fall , '' said a fund manager , requesting anonymity . The market regulator has asked MF trustees to have a report ready by end of this month , which reviews total exposure through such structures `` during the last two years i.e. from January , 2017 onwards including outstanding exposure as on date . '' According to sources , the regulator wants to know whether MFs have proper contingency plans in place as despite being debt instruments , volatility in equity markets has a bearing on the credit quality of these exposures . According to a recent note by CRISIL , `` around 90 per cent of the rated pledge debt of Rs 38,000 crore had cover of less than two-times -- even as low as 1.2 or 1.3 times . '' This is lower than what the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) stipulates for non-banking financial companies ( NBFCs ) that lend against shares . The RBI stipulates that all NBFCs with more than Rs 100 crore asset size need to maintain a loan-to-value ( LTV ) of 50 per cent where listed shares are placed as collateral . An LTV of 50 per cent means that for a Rs 50,000 loan , the market value of the collateral shares needs to be Rs 1 lakh . This translates into two times share cover . The CRISIL note points out that low equity cover heightens the risks for MFs and other investors as unlike NBFCs and banks , they do n't have enough capital buffers . `` Considering high equity volatility , low covers of 1.2 or 1.3-times may not be able to provide adequate cushion and avert a default on the debt . While NBFCs and banks have capital cushion to absorb risks as per regulatory capital adequacy norms , others do not have any such leeway , '' the note read . The industry officials say the inherent risk in such structures stems from the fact that there is no underlying cash flow . `` Promoter-funding structures such as LAS have no real cash flows . A typical promoter company only gets dividend income . These structures are largely built around refinance , '' said Amandeep Chopra , group president and head of fixed income at UTI MF . The risks have got exacerbated as such structures are finding limited sources of funding in the current environment of tight liquidity . `` With NBFCs becoming wary of doing roll-overs for such structures , these could see a continued build-up of stress , '' Chopra added . The strain in loan-against-shares structures had prompted MFs to enter into standstill agreement with the promoters as selling the pledged shares could trigger downgrade and negatively impact the exposed funds ' net asset value . Sebi had earlier sought details of MFs ' debt exposure to Essel group companies after both sides entered into an agreement to hold back selling of the promoter entities ' pledged shares . According to reports , the RBI is also looking at the recent cases of ` standstill ' agreements between the borrowers and the lenders .

The Additive Manufacturing Platform Ranking competitive assessment ranked 10 major vendors of the technology -- 3D Systems , Carbon , Desktop Metal , Digital Alloys , EOS , ExOne , GE Additive , HP , Renishaw , and Stratasys -- using ABI Research 's proven , unbiased innovation/implementation criteria framework . Each vendor was analyzed based on a combination of AM technology process , material science , software , process and application adaptability , GTM , revenue and bookings , availability , customer references , partnerships , cost , and channel strategy . To qualify as an additive manufacturing platform vendor , the company had to have a production additive manufacturing solution on the market , be targeting production AM as its main opportunity , or be working with promising metal alloy AM technologies and techniques that could , in ABI Research 's view , prove a strong fit for the production AM market . These platforms will produce more than US$ 360 billion worth of parts and end products each year and nearly US$ 2 trillion in sum by the end of the next decade . Stratasys scored highest in implementation , followed by 3D Systems , EOS , Desktop Metal , and GE Additive . `` Stratasys , 3D Systems , and EOS are the market incumbents -- all have been involved in AM since their inception . 3D Systems went neck-and-neck with Stratasys in all categories , expect partnerships , where it was edged out by Stratasys due to Stratasys ' investment in Desktop Metal , collaboration with companies like Siemens , and work with its own global manufacturing network , which companies like UPS use to automatically invoke AM rather than traditional manufacturing processes based on order volume requests , '' explained Ryan Martin , Principal Analyst at ABI Research . Desktop Metal was the surprise frontrunner among companies to more recently enter the AM arena , edging out incumbents like GE Additive and EOS on the powder-bed side and dusting ExOne and HP in terms of performance on binder jetting . `` Desktop Metal was the technology category leader but could be challenged in the long run if GE Additive and others can cultivate a credible metal binder jetting solution . Others to watch are Carbon , which recently launched its L1 production system , and Digital Alloys , which has a savvy GTM strategy that aligns well with the strength of its Joule Printing technology , '' Martin said . `` Desktop Metal took the top spot for innovation due to the applicability of its core technology and the capabilities of its production system relative to others in its category ; Desktop Metal is the binder jetting technology category leader , and binder jetting as a technology blows PBF out of the water when it comes to the scale of true production applications . Carbon and GE Additive tied for second and were only 2.5 % behind Desktop Metal . Digital Alloys was the surprise fast follower to the runner up position . Digital Alloys has a technology that could displace if not converge with the DED category ( where companies like Sciaky play ) due to the speed , quality , and affordability of Joule printing , '' concluded Martin .

Pic : Michael McLaughlin Disappointment for Achill 's McHugh after exit-poll hopes seem dashed Edwin McGreal Shrule 's Maria Walsh looks set to take a second seat for Fine Gael in the four-seat Midlands North West European Parliament constituency . The second-count results last night ( Monday ) have the former Rose of Tralee comfortably in fourth place following the distribution of running-mate Mair\u00e9ad McGuinness 's surplus . Walsh took an impressive 38 percent of McGuinness 's surplus , 6,036 votes , to leave her on a total of 70,536 . That places Walsh over 12,000 votes ahead of Peter Casey ( Independent ) in fifth place , and almost 18,000 votes ahead of Achill 's Saoirse McHugh ( Green Party ) in sixth . McGuinness was elected on the first count early yesterday afternoon with a very strong vote of 134,630 . With the quota set at 118,986 , that gave McGuinness a surplus of 15,734 . Comfortably placed after the first count in second and third place , respectively , were outgoing MEPs Luke ` Ming ' Flanagan ( Independent , 85,034 votes ) and Matt Carthy ( Sinn F\u00e9in , 77,619 votes ) . The full count is unlikely to be completed before Thursday . Hopes dashed There had been high hopes for two Mayo MEPs after an RT\u00c9 / TG4 Exit Poll was revealed on Friday night . It put 28-year-old McHugh in third place on 12 percent following an impressive display on an RT\u00c9 debate earlier that week . The exit poll also had Mair\u00e9ad McGuinness on 25 percent , Matt Carthy on 15 percent , Maria Walsh and Luke ` Ming ' Flanagan locked on 10 percent each and Peter Casey on 7 percent . McHugh and her team were in high spirits on Saturday morning at the prospect of a shock outcome . However , sample tallies on Saturday raised the probability of the margin of error in the exit poll being quite high -- and so it proved when the first count results were revealed . Flanagan actually polled at 14 percent while McHugh polled under 9 percent . McHugh is now up against it to make it into the top four . `` From the tallies for the second preferences , it does n't look like I 'll catch up , '' McHugh admitted to The Mayo News last night . `` I 'm disappointed in one way , considering the exit poll , but I 've come around to being really heartened by the performance . `` Someone said to me my first preference would nearly fill the Aviva Stadium [ she got 51,019 votes , the stadium capacity is 51,700 ] . That 's kinda cool . I could n't name 1,000 people I know , never mind 51,000 . `` If anything , the vote shows how important people think the issue of climate action is . We increased our vote five-fold on the last European election in this constituency , and we got the vote we did with a tiny budget and a really small team , learning as we went along , '' she said . McHugh added that she does not know if she will stand in the general election for the Green Party , but she remains ` hopeful but sceptical ' about how seriously the Irish Government is taking the issue of climate change . `` You should always believe what people do , not what they say . Just today ( Monday ) Richard Bruton and Se\u00e1n Canney , Government ministers , signed another oil exploration license . If anything screams ` we 're not listening ' , it 's that , '' said McHugh .

The past four days were among the country 's top 10 warmest on record , with temperatures nearing 50 degrees Celsius ( 122 degrees Fahrenheit ) in some spots , the Bureau of Meteorology said Wednesday . `` With South Australia breaking some all-time records yesterday , it would certainly put this region as one of the warmest parts of the world yesterday , if not the warmest , '' the bureau 's senior meteorologist Philip Perkins told AFP . `` The places that broke records yesterday are already warmer at this time today as they were yesterday . '' High temperatures are not unusual in Australia during its arid southern hemisphere summer , with bushfires a common occurrence . But climate change has pushed up land and sea temperatures and led to more extremely hot days and severe fire seasons . Among the towns in South Australia state experiencing their hottest temperatures on record Tuesday was tiny Tarcoola in the region 's far north , which reached 49 degrees Celsius . The city of Port Augusta recorded a temperature of 48.9 degrees Celsius , almost one degree higher than its previous record set on February 7 , 2009 -- the same day Victoria state endured the devastating `` Black Saturday '' bushfires that left 173 dead in the nation 's worst natural disaster . The desert town of Coober Pedy -- where some residents live underground to escape the harsh conditions -- equalled its temperature record of 47.4 degrees Celsius . In the state 's capital Adelaide , where cycling 's Tour Down Under and the cricket One Day International between Australia and India were being held , athletes sweltered through a maximum temperature of 41.9 degree Celsius . Overnight temperatures were also set to remain high , before a rapid change to cooler conditions from late Thursday when a cold front currently over the Southern Ocean sweeps across southern Australia , Perkins said . `` Everything 's sort of a bit of a pressure cooker at the moment , and everything 's getting hotter and more humid and we 're all doing a slow clap waiting for this change to come through , '' he added . Australia 's creatures , already battered by a drought plaguing the east of the vast continent , are also feeling the heat . Up to one million fish are believed to have died along the banks of a major river system , with authorities warning of more deaths to come as temperatures soar . The New South Wales state government said it would install aerators in some waterways to keep the levels of oxygen up for fish to reduce the likelihood of more mass deaths .

By Press Association 2019 The Arak heavy water reactor 0 comment The UK , France and Germany have begun proceedings against Iran over breaches of its nuclear deal . But what is the row about and will the deal survive ? -- What is the deal ? The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action dates back to 2015 , a time when Western governments believed Tehran was dangerously close to making a nuclear weapon . Along with Iran , signatories to the deal included three European countries -- the E3 of the UK , France and Germany -- Russia , China and the US . The agreement eased international sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran agreeing to restrictions on its nuclear programme to ensure it was for civilian purposes , and rigorous inspections . -- Did it work ? Iran has not developed a nuclear weapon , the scenario the international community was eager to avoid . The Iran Deal is defective at its core . If we do nothing , we know what will happen . In just a short time , the world 's leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world 's most dangerous weapons ... . pic.twitter.com/58qwBLzxIH -- Donald J. Trump ( @realDonaldTrump ) May 8 , 2018 But the agreement ran into trouble after Donald Trump withdrew in 2018 , claiming predecessor Barack Obama 's `` disastrous deal '' allowed Tehran access to too much cash and did nothing to stop its `` malign behaviour '' in the Middle East . The reimposition of US sanctions as part of Mr Trump 's `` maximum pressure '' strategy has eroded the benefits of the deal to Iran 's economy , and in response Tehran has carried out a phased process of stepping back from its commitments . `` Since last May , Iran has step by step reduced its compliance with critical elements of the JCPoA , leaving it a shell of an agreement . '' FS @DominicRaab pic.twitter.com/ZhAA6897kc -- Foreign Office ? ? ? ? ( @foreignoffice ) January 14 , 2020 -- What happens now ? While the deal is not yet dead , it has effectively been placed on life support after the E3 started the dispute resolution mechanism . This was triggered by Iran declaring on January 5 that it was discarding the last component of the limitations imposed by the deal and no longer faced `` any operational restrictions '' on its nuclear programme . Under the dispute resolution mechanism , Tehran will be given 15 days to respond , a term which can be rolled over indefinitely -- so the move is aimed at buying time to reach a diplomatic solution . In light of the Iranian non compliance with the nuclear agreement , Germany , France and Great Britain have triggered the Dispute Resolution Mechanism within the framework of the #JCPoA . \u27a1 \ufe0f joint statement of the three Foreign Ministers : https://t.co/SRmAXQ0RaF -- GermanForeignOffice ( @GermanyDiplo ) January 14 , 2020 -- Will the deal survive ? The UK and its allies felt they had to act to prevent the deal being so badly hollowed out that it no longer fulfilled its purpose of preventing Tehran acquiring weapons-grade nuclear material . But there is little optimism in Whitehall that merely triggering the dispute process will result in an immediate change in behaviour from Tehran . Ultimately the process could result in a return to the UN Security Council and the reimposition of sanctions , although that is not what the UK wants . -- What are the alternatives ? Right now , the JCPOA is the only deal on the table and the UK and its allies have publicly confirmed their commitment to it . But Boris Johnson has also urged Mr Trump to come up with an alternative proposal he would be willing to support , noting that one of the US president 's main objections to the deal is that it was negotiated by the predecessor he loathes . `` Let 's work together to replace the JCPOA and get the Trump deal instead , '' Mr Johnson said . 0 comment", "date": "2020-01-14 14:31:27", "url": "http://www.creweguardian.co.uk/news/national/18159334.irans-troubled-nuclear-deal---happens-now/", "phase": "E", "title": "Iran 's troubled nuclear deal -- what happens now ?", "names": [{"name": "donald j. trump", "ids": ["Q22686"], "offsets": [[218, 221]]}, {"name": "donald trump", "ids": ["Q22686", "Q27947481"], "offsets": [[235, 237], [281, 282], [650, 651], [701, 702]]}, {"name": "barack obama", "ids": ["Q76"], "offsets": [[243, 245]]}, {"name": "boris johnson", "ids": ["Q180589"], "offsets": [[644, 646], [707, 708]]}]}, {"articleID": "2009052719_00063617_W", "content": "the climate group and the united nations development programme ( undp ) have signed an important mou committing to help subnational governments , in both developed and developing countries , take ambitious climate action . this collaboration will focus its efforts on forging partnerships between developed and developing country regions to implement actions in energy efficiency , renewable energy , technology transfer , and adaptation across continental borders . the signing of the mou fulfills one of the commitments the statement of action which state and regional leaders delivered to the unfccc in december 2008 . steve howard , ceo of the climate group , welcomed the partnership : `` the climate group works with leading states and regions around the world to accelerate practical low carbon policy solutions ; from mandating innovative energy efficiency programs and renewable energy use to introducing clean car standards . `` our new joint commitment with the united nations development program is significant and will ensure that progressive action and best practice in emissions reduction can be transferred between developed and developing country regions around the world to speed and concert global efforts to combat climate change .

He had been the last known World War II Nazi living in the U.S. Jakiw Palij immigrated to America in 1949 , claiming he had worked on his father 's farm during World War II . But a Justice Department investigation , based on evidence compiled by a senior historian at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum , found that Palij served as an armed guard of civilian prisoners at a forced-labor camp for Jews at the Trawniki camp in Poland . That 's where Nazi SS troops were trained to kill Polish Jews . A federal judge stripped Jakiw Palij of his citizenship in 2003 , finding that he had lied when he came to the U.S. . He was ordered deported in 2004 , but no country would take him until Germany finally relented last year . This week , at the age of 95 , Palij died . He was never charged for his involvement in the Holocaust . `` An evil man has passed away , '' Rabbi Zev Meir Friedman told The Associated Press . `` That , I guess , is a positive . '' Friedman had led multiple student protests in front of Palij 's home in the Queens borough of New York City . It had looked as though the aging Palij would die in the U.S. , CNN reported in 2016 . But there was continued lawmaker interest in deporting the war criminal . A bipartisan group of New York 's congressional delegation wrote to then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in 2017 , urging him to make the matter a priority . Palij 's continued residence in New York was a `` painful reminder for Americans who fought against the Nazis or lost loved ones in the Holocaust , '' said the letter , signed by 21 members of Congress . `` We are deeply concerned that the deportation of Mr. Palij is stalled and urge your personal intervention on the matter . '' President Trump told Fox News last year he made the deportation of Palij a priority after many presidents had not . `` From the beginning of the campaign , they tell me about this Nazi who lived in Queens , who walks the street like he owns the place , '' Trump said . `` The Obama administration was unable to pull it off , '' Trump said of the deportation . `` And , frankly , the Bush administration was unable to pull it off . And I was able to pull it off . '' The U.S. ambassador to Germany , Richard Grenell , said he had raised the question of Palij 's deportation in every meeting with German officials , based in part on the urging of the president , NPR reported . With a new government installed in Berlin , there was `` new energy '' for negotiations , he said . Germany agreed to accept Palij in August . That month , federal immigration agents carried Palij out of his home on a stretcher , into an ambulance and onto a plane . `` Palij 's removal sends a strong message : The United States will not tolerate those who facilitated Nazi crimes and other human rights violations , and they will not find a safe haven on American soil , '' press secretary Sarah Sanders said in August . More than 70 years since the war ended , the pain of Nazi atrocities still reverberates around the globe . On Friday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel apologized to Greek President Prokopis Pavlopoulos for the damage inflicted on Greece by Hitler 's forces . `` We are aware of our historical responsibility , '' said Merkel . `` We know how much suffering Germany caused Greece during the era of National Socialism . '' But German authorities never charged Palij for his involvement in the atrocities of Trawniki . Jens Rommel , the head of the Central Office for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes , told reporters that there was n't enough evidence to prosecute him . `` There is no investigation into him in Germany , which means there is no arrest warrant , and as a result , it is not very likely that he will ever be convicted , '' Rommel told the broadcaster Deutsche Welle last year . `` The difficulty lies not so much in describing the murders , the individual massacres , the functions of those at a camp , but in determining the individual 's responsibility , '' Rommel said . `` By what action , by carrying out what duty , by what function did the individual facilitate this murder ? That is what we have to prove . And with mobile units , which some of these Trawniki men were in , that 's extremely difficult . '' New York lawmaker Dov Hikind , who had fought for the deportation , told the AP that Palij 's death brings `` the closure survivors of the Holocaust needed . '' German prosecutors have intensified their hunt for the last remaining Nazis before they die of old age , USA Today reported last year . Nazi hunters estimated that dozens of Nazis could still be alive . Copyright 2019 NPR .

You may be looking for other uses of Karina . Karina the Great [ Source ] '' My empire is forever ! My empire can not end ! '' -- Queen Karina [ src ] Karina the Great was a Geonosian queen , one who held the same name as the queen who reigned during the Clone Wars . The last of her kind , she was born during the reign of the Galactic Empire , and the egg from which she hatched survived the Empire 's genocide on Geonosis . Prior to her birth , her egg was protected by a Geonosian known as Klik-Klak , who kept it safe from both the Empire and the rebel extremist Saw Gerrera . Klik-Klak hoped Karina would be able to repopulate the Geonosian species , but she was sterile and instead attached a mechanical womb to her body . From that womb , she produced B1 battle droids that she regarded as children and the future of her planet . During the Galactic Civil War , Karina 's existence was discovered by the Sith Lord Darth Vader , who traveled to Geonosis to steal her battle droid factory and use it to build an army to regain the power and prestige he lost after being blamed for the destruction of the Empire 's Death Star battle station during the Battle of Yavin . Karina attempted to thwart Vader 's plot with her army of droids , but the Sith Lord and his companions -- rogue archaeologist Chelli Lona Aphra and the assassin droids BT-1 and 0-0-0 -- severed and stole her mechanical womb to build battle droids of his own . Contents [ show ] Biography Edit Last of her kind Edit '' If that egg is the last chance to save his people , then we have to help him protect it . '' -- Ezra Bridger [ src ] Klik-Klak protects the last known Geonosian queen egg from Saw Gerrera . At the end of the Clone Wars , the newly-formed Galactic Empire moved construction of the Death Star superweapon away from Geonosis , where it had been under construction by Geonosian weapons builders . [ 6 ] To protect the secret of the Death Star , the Empire wiped out the Geonosian people using poison gas [ 2 ] and left the planet a barren wasteland . [ 7 ] Only one Geonosian , [ 8 ] later known as Klik-Klak , [ 2 ] survived the genocide . [ 2 ] By 2 BBY , [ 3 ] he held in his possession the last known egg containing a Geonosian queen . Klik-Klak knew that the safe hatching of this egg was the only way to repopulate Geonosis , so he fiercely protected it in the hopes of giving his people another chance at life . [ 2 ] Klik-Klak felt forced to defend the egg when resistance fighter Saw Gerrera led a team of rebels to investigate intelligence reports pointing to suspicious Imperial activity on the planet -- which , though unknown to the fledging Rebel Alliance , was the remnants of the Death Star project . Gerrera 's team investigated an energy reading near where Klik-Klak was hiding the egg , so he ambushed the rebels and killed everyone but Gerrera . [ 2 ] Another rebel team , the Spectres , traveled Geonosis to look for Gerrera and his soldiers , and they encountered Klik-Klak while investigating the energy readings on the planet . They discovered that Klik-Klak was protecting the egg , which Gerrera -- known in the wider rebellion for his extremist tactics -- threatened to destroy if Klik-Klak refused to reveal all he knew about the Empire 's activities on Geonosis . The Spectres , particularly the young Jedi Ezra Bridger , convinced Gerrera to back down . After helping the rebels discover the poison gas that was used to wipe out the planet 's population , Klik-Klak retreated deeper beneath the planet 's surface where , one day , he hoped the egg would hatch safely . [ 2 ] The egg ultimately did hatch , [ 1 ] and the queen who was born from it took on the name Karina the Great , [ 5 ] the same name once used by the Geonosian queen who reigned during the Clone Wars . [ 9 ] Encounter with Darth Vader Edit '' Interesting tweaks on the standard droid design , too . I suspect she does n't see these as droids . I suppose that it does make sense . Immortal queens , sterilized . The urge to continue the species by any means necessary . When biology fails , she turns to science . They are n't droids to her . They 're children . '' -- Chelli Lona Aphra [ src ] Klik-Klak 's hopes of repopulating his species were ultimately dashed . Karina , who took shelter in a subterranean lair , lost her biological womb and was left sterile . Unable to repopulate her species , Karina replaced her womb with a portable droid factory acting as a mechanical womb -- biology had failed her , so she turned to science to repopulate her species by any means necessary . Rather than Geonosians , she produced many B1 battle droids , altered to look like her people . She considered the droids her children and was fiercely protective of them , seeing them as a means to rebuild an empire on Geonosis . [ 5 ] The Droid Gotra discovered her existence and took a keen interest in her and her droid children . [ 10 ] Darth Vader traveled to Geonosis to steal the droid factory from Karina . After the Battle of Yavin and the destruction of the Death Star , the Sith Lord Darth Vader sought to build a new base of power after being blamed for the loss of the Death Star . [ 11 ] After learning of Karina 's droid factory , Vader traveled to Geonosis with the rogue archaeologist Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra and her assassin droids , BT-1 and 0-0-0 . [ 10 ] Once they arrived , they made their way into the Geonosian catacombs , where Karina 's droid children tried and failed to stop them from proceeding to her lair . Vader found Karina and used his lightsaber to sever the droid factory from her body . Injured but alive , Karina unleashed her battle droids against the Sith Lord , refusing to allow the future of her reign and all of Geonosis to be taken by an Empire that had already stolen so much from them . Vader and his companions dispatched the droids and escaped on Vader 's starship with the droid factory in tow . Karina survived the encounter , all while proclaiming that her empire would not end . [ 5 ] Personality and traits Edit '' Stop them ! They 've ruined our past . They ca n't destroy our future ! '' -- Karina the Great to her battle droid children , when Darth Vader attacked them [ src ] Karina distraught after Darth Vader stole her mechanical womb . Karina the Great was a Geonosian female with black eyes and gray and tan skin . [ 5 ] She was the last known Geonosian queen . Her successful hatching from an egg [ 2 ] some time prior to the Battle of Yavin [ 5 ] signified the potential to repopulate the Geonosian species after it was wiped out by the Galactic Empire . [ 2 ] That potential was dashed , as Karina was sterile and could not produce offspring by the time Darth Vader encountered her . Instead , she was fitted with a mechanical womb so she could produce battle droid offspring . She was fiercely protective of these droids and considered them her children , her one and only way of restoring an empire on Geonosis . Doctor Aphra remarked that , when biology failed , Karina turned to science to ensure that Geonosis could live on . [ 5 ] Behind the scenes Edit '' Again : long game . '' -- Pablo Hidalgo , on the story of Karina the Great being told across transmedia [ src ] This Karina the Great was introduced in the comic book Darth Vader 4 : Vader , Part IV . The comic was released on April 8 , 2015 and was written by Kieron Gillen , with art by Salvador Larroca . [ 5 ] She was the second such character introduced in the Star Wars canon ; another Karina the Great was introduced in '' Legacy of Terror , '' a second season episode of the animated television series Star Wars : The Clone Wars . [ 12 ] Both characters hold the title of Karina the Great , with Pablo Hidalgo of the Lucasfilm Story Group stating that `` the Queen is always Karina the Great , so to speak . '' [ 13 ] This particular Karina 's backstory was revealed in '' Ghosts of Geonosis , '' [ 2 ] the January 7 , 2017 [ 14 ] episode of the third season of the animated television series Star Wars Rebels . Though the character herself does not appear , the egg that she later hatches from is a vital part of the episode , as is the idea of preserving the Geonosian race after the Empire carried out its genocide on the planet . [ 2 ] On February 25 , 2016 , after the Star Wars Rebels episode '' The Honorable Ones '' suggested there were no signs of life on Geonosis , Hidalgo remarked on Twitter that it `` Makes you wonder where that queen came from , '' in reference to this Karina . [ 15 ] After the airing of `` Ghosts of Geonosis , '' he confirmed that the egg did indeed contain this Karina , and that it represented the `` long game '' that Lucasfilm is playing in regards to transmedia storytelling .

a minority offshoot of the shi'a , as are the arabs of hizbullah in lebanon and the non-arab mullahs of iran - falls to the dominant sunni islamist parties who are leading the revolt , like those which toppled mubarak in egypt and other despots in adjacent countries , please consider the following episode . when kurds in qamishli rose up against assad and the arabist ba ` th in the spring of 2004 and were slaughtered , syrian arabs of all stripes remained quiet . there was no mention of the kurds ' courage in confronting the brutality and repression of the regime , their revolt was condemned , and they were accused of being mere separatists . new york times columnist , thomas friedman , can also only manage to call some 35 million truly stateless kurds by that same separatist word , while repeatedly lionizing the arabs ' quest for a 22nd state alongside , or instead of , israel . it 's that same old subjugating arab mindset - again , and again , and again . in the arabs ' own words , the whole region is simply viewed as `` purely arab patrimony '' - and to hell with everyone else who dares to protest , be they millions of copts , imazighen/berbers , black african sudanese , kurds , assyrians , native kilab yahud ( `` jew dogs '' ) , or whomever . here is how this concept is proclaimed in syria 's ba ` thist arab constitution - an idea espoused by sunni arabs now seeking to topple alawi arabs at least as much - and probably more - than the latter : the so-called arab `` fatherland '' belongs solely to the arabs . they alone have the right to direct its destinies . the arab `` fatherland '' is that part of the globe inhabited by the arab nation which stretches from the taurus mountains , the pacht-i-kouh mountains , the gulf of basra , the arab ocean , the ethiopian mountains , the sahara , the atlantic ocean , and the mediterranean sea . now , in case you think that things have changed in light of recent events , please consider that over the past months when the syrian opposition held many conferences to draw up a plan for syria 's future , kurds attended as well . for the most part , they were totally ignored-even by the american state department , an apparent fan of islamists of most stripes . reports stated , for example , that during the opposition conference in istanbul in mid-july 2011 , the kurdish demand that kurds be recognized as a second ethnic group in syria simply fell on deaf ears . the kurds ' second demand - to rename the syrian arab republic to simply the republic of syria-angered many opposition leaders who interpreted the kurdish suggestion as a plan to strip syria of its `` true '' ( i.e. , arab ) identity . compounding the kurds ' arab problem is the fact that the main arab opposition parties in syria are primarily supported by like-minded anti-kurdish islamist parties in turkey and those assorted arabian peninsula sunni arabs mentioned above . as usual , the kurds will likely be used and abused yet again by all parties involved - including their own leaders . in neighboring iraq , for example , the kurdish regional government has its own hands full playing a balancing act with iran , ankara , and so forth and so has not really been constructive in helping out its syrian kurdish brethren . add to this the problems with the militant pkk bogeyman ( which would not even exist if kurds had been afforded basic human , let alone political , rights ) - and the legitimate aspirations for freedom and autonomy of kurds and other non-arab peoples in a future syria appear distant indeed . the main problem is that when it comes to what `` democracy '' would likely look like , the weight of the evidence does not look good for a post-assad syria . too many syrian opposition leaders fighting the assad regime appear to adhere to concepts and policies similar to those of assad or any of syria 's earlier arab dictators . and those wanting something better ( like the sdc ) are being ignored by the powers that be elsewhere . denise natali , of the institute for national strategic studies ( inss ) at national defense university , wrote a uselful analysis regarding a series of meetings in qatar dealing with this very issue while a turk/arab more preferred sunni regime would replace the alawis , non-arabs such as kurds or assyrians in syria will have no more to look forward to with it than egypt 's non-arab copts now do . all have a history of being subjugated and ruthlessly massacred by their arab neighbors . the ba ` th in neighboring sunni arab saddam 's iraq killed hundreds of thousands of kurds over the years as well , both before and during the anfal campaign of the '80s . while there may be more liberal voices in both egypt and syria , the power lies elsewhere and those wielding it will likely be no more tolerant ( probably less ) than the regimes which they toppled . having said this , recent events in egypt -- where the muslim brotherhood is encountering increasing opposition to its subjugating agenda -- are a pleasant surprise . to say that the situation is a tinderbox is an understatement , but those hoping that the powerful military will intervene are probably in for a rude awakening . there seems to have been a trade-off made between the ikhwan and the officers -- one which safeguards the latters ' extensive economic interests in particular . so , forget about a coup toppling president morsi -- especially since more of the officer corps these days have links themselves to the muslim brotherhood . now , some may say that since democracy is so new in that region of the world ( with the exception of the nation almost everyone loves to vilify ) , it must be given time to evolve . fair enough . america 's own democracy needed time too . but , the problem with this line of thought is that the ability to evolve into something better requires a tolerance of diversity for `` the other '' , almost entirely missing from the dominant , age-old subjugating arab mindset -- despite claims to the contrary , the `` golden age of spain , '' and so forth . perhaps egypt 's best known copt , dr. boutros boutros-ghali , president sadat 's foreign minister , summed this up best when he met israeli author , amos elon . in elon 's `` flight into egypt '' ( new york , 1980 , pp. 84-91 ) , he reviewed his encounter with boutros-ghali . here 's some excerpts : in his office , there is a map of the middle east on which israel is still blacked out . israel must integrate by accepting the nature of the area -- that nature that is arab . in a tape of a long discourse delivered in 1975 to professor brecher he proclaimed that in the vast area between the persian gulf and the atlantic ocean everyone had to be arab or risk continuing strife . still , boutros-ghali felt that there might be a solution . how ? well , israel could become an arab country . most israelis were ( jewish ) immigrants from arab countries anyway . whether a copt in egypt , kabyle/amazigh ( `` berber '' ) in north africa , jew , kurd , or whomever , the only way for non-arabs to be tolerated is for them to accept the arab rules of the game ( whether their arab masters are sunni or shi'a ) and turn themselves into `` uncle tom '' uncle boutroses . all have to accept forced arabization , to one degree or another . the problem is really two-fold here - having both religious and racist dimensions - and committed by the same people who lecture about allegedly racist zionism . you see , unlike the non-arab christian copts or assyrians , the non-arab `` berbers , '' kurds , black africans in darfur , and others are indeed muslim -- but not arab . whether sunni or shi'a , and no matter how often the former blow each other apart , arabs wo n't tolerate what they call `` another israel '' being born in what they claim as `` purely arab patrimony . '' left up to them , they wo n't even tolerate anything which might be seen as steps in that direction -- such as a federal syria with autonomous kurdish and other non-arab areas . that which exists in iraq today in the krg , courtesy of america 's overthrow of saddam , is becoming under increasing threat daily from the dominant shi'a arabs now in control in baghdad . the oil of the millennia-old kurdish heartland in kirkuk is the current flashpoint . what must also be remembered is that up until very recently , for a variety of reasons , washington and others have largely turned a blind eye to the numerous atrocities committed by the syrian regime-whether they were directed against lebanon 's quest for freedom , israel 's jews , native kurds , native sunni arabs in the elder assad 's infamous `` hama solution , '' or whomever . indeed , despite all of the above , israel was repeatedly offered up on a silver platter to the syrians in exchange for just a bit more cooperation in lebanon and in iraq . there were active plans to force israel into a total retreat from the strategic golan heights which israel took , at great cost , after it was forced to fight - largely due to syrian instigation and machinations - in the june '67 war . prior to that time , the heights ( part of the original 1920 mandate of palestine ) were used by syria to bombard israeli fishermen and farmers repeatedly . since that war , israel has repeatedly offered to exchange the vast majority of the land for true peace - something the arabs have rejected . as usual , the latter expect that their repeated aggression will come totally cost free . that territory has indeed frequently changed hands all over the globe due to such aggression . early in president obama 's administration , he sent his good friend and arafat 's bosom buddy , robert malley , to the younger assad with the same offer president george h. w. bush 's secretary of state , james baker iii , offered to his father -- a complete israeli withdrawal from the heights in return for some nice gestures towards america and others , but not israel . what 's even more disturbing is that , with all that has recently transpired during the so-called `` arab spring '' ( and the uncertainty and instability inherent in these events ) , the american state department will still expect that the jews will expose themselves yet again tp such arab despots or alleged arab islamist jihadi `` democrats . '' even worse , the man now occupying the white house is on record repeatedly stating the israel would be crazy ( his exact words ) not to accept the saudi peace plan , the basis of the current non-negotiations . among other things , that saudi `` peace '' ( of the grave ) plan calls for a total withdrawal by israel to its pre - '67 armistice lines ( not borders ) which made it a mere 9-15 miles wide at its strategic waist-where the vast majority of its population lives . most people travel further than that just to go to work . the final draft of unsc resolution 242 , the main post - '67 tool for peacemaking , specifically does not call upon israel to do this , as has often been noted elsewhere . so , i have mixed feelings about what is now transpiring in syria . if replacing secular butchers with jihadi ones instead is the choice , thanks but no thanks . one part of me wants to see the bloodshed stopped ; but , my other consciousness warns that those now in revolt will be no better to their own perceived enemies than those whom they seek to replace . one set of massacres and victims will simply be replaced by another . and , if anything , as with what is evolving in egypt and elsewhere in the region , what and who will likely replace the reigning despot in syria ( is there any other type of ruler in the `` arab '' world ? ) will only prove to be even more hostile to jews , kurds , assyrian christians , and scores of millions of other non-arab peoples in the region . having stated all of this , it is true that another argument could be made for severing iran 's link to its hizbullah proxies-who have all but taken over lebanon and who have scores of thousands of missiles aimed at israel from just a bit over the border-by toppling the regime in syria which serves as the primary middle man for such aid . the problem , however , is that , depite that relative good news , once again , the devil which will replace assad will very likely be as bad or worse than the current regime itself when it comes to israel , kurds , true democracy western style , and so forth . and yet , it does not necessarily have to be this way . if washington and others can finally muster what it takes to support the truly more inclusive and tolerant elements of the syrian opposition -- like those in the syrian democratic coalition of sherkoh abbas 's folks -- a much brighter future for syria and all of its neighbors could emerge when the dust finally settles . those who still seek to suppress the human and political rights of others may not like this development ( such as turks who still refuse to call kurds `` kurds , '' but rename them `` mountain turks '' instead ) , but the cause of freedom can not be held captive to such folks . while most arabs distrust iranian shi'a connections with the offshoot syrian arab alawi and the lebanese arab shi'a hizbullah ( hence their support of assad 's foes ) , there is no doubt that sunni arab attitudes towards the issue of non-arab rights in the region are , for the most part , as bad or worse . hamas and the muslim brotherhood are sunni , for example-and all call for the death of israel and the slaughter of jews . the butchers of kurds during the arabs ' anfal campaign in iraq in the '80s were sunnis . ditto for most of the arab genocidal maniacs in the sudan . and so forth . again , using egypt as the model , the same islamists now in control there , from whom the hamas rulers of gaza earlier sprung , will likely be calling the shots ( both figuratively and literally ) in a post-assad syria .", "date": "2012-12-17 07:32:00", "url": "http://israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/12598", "phase": "C", "title": "syria : fears and facts get in the way of sympathy - op-eds - israel national news", "names": [{"name": "thomas friedman", "ids": ["Q310950"], "offsets": [[805, 807]]}, {"name": "boutros boutros-ghali", "ids": ["Q1257"], "offsets": [[1811, 1813], [1856, 1857], [1940, 1941]]}, {"name": "amos elon", "ids": ["Q329124"], "offsets": [[1830, 1832], [1834, 1835]]}, {"name": "president obama", "ids": ["Q76"], "offsets": [[2472, 2473]]}, {"name": "robert malley", "ids": ["Q7347302"], "offsets": [[2487, 2489]]}, {"name": "president george h. w. bush", "ids": ["Q23505"], "offsets": [[2499, 2503]]}, {"name": "james baker", "ids": ["Q103854", "Q18671532", "Q21284586", "Q21456471", "Q223151", "Q28916440", "Q49481016", "Q6129263", "Q6129269"], "offsets": [[2508, 2510]]}]}, {"articleID": "2019080703_00169266_W", "content": "Khalilzad briefs Jaishankar on Afghan peace process Khalilzad briefs Jaishankar on Afghan peace process Wed , Aug 7 2019 08:56:33 AM New Delhi , Aug 7 ( IANS ) : US special envoy on Afghanistan , Zalmay Khalilzad met External Affairs Minister S.

In 2019 , Aussie stocks delivered their best returns in a decade , up almost 24 per cent including dividends , and market forecasters do n't expect a repeat performance in 2020 . Diversifying with shares outside Australia is a no-brainer among super funds and professional investment managers , but many individuals still stick to their own backyard . This overexposure is dangerous , and unnecessary now that it 's easier than ever to invest overseas . Online and full-service stockbrokers allow people to buy overseas shares directly , managed funds and exchange-traded funds hold a broad range of international stocks , and investment platforms such as stake.com . au offer access to US stocks with as little as $ 50 . `` With more opportunity available outside the local market , there is little reason to limit your investing , '' said Stake founder and CEO Matthew Leibowitz . `` The more access to opportunity you have , the more chance you have of being successful . '' Mr Leibowitz said people investing overseas should understand their capital was at risk , just like it was with any investment . Not a mickey mouse investment : Disney shares are tipped to do well in 2020 He said a survey of some of Stake 's 50,000 users found they expected Telsa , Disney and Microsoft to do well this year , but planned to avoid Netflix , Uber and oil company investments . Investment forecasters are upbeat about the outlook for global shares this year , with the caveat that anything can happen in a world with a US-China trade war and potentially a US-Iran real war . Aviva Investors head of investment strategy Michael Grady said global share valuations were at or above long-term averages but his firm 's view was still positive . `` A gentle recovery in earnings should also help , '' he said . AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said improving global growth and low interest rates should drive reasonable investment returns this year . `` Global shares are expected to see total returns around 9.5 per cent , helped by better growth and easy monetary policy , '' he said . The best performers were likely to be emerging market shares and non-US stocks , Dr Oliver said . Global asset manager Eaton Vance 's co-director , Eric Stein , said he expected global economic activity to improve . `` I think all eyes are going to be on the U.S. presidential election in 2020 - both the Democratic primary process as well as the general election in November , '' he said . `` Given how different the parties and likely candidates will be , we could see very different market outcomes .

A participant holds a poster amid NGO representatives staging a sit-in protest closed to the plenary session to denounce the first draft COP21 Climate Conference agreement , and put pressure to reach an international agreement ... LE BOURGET , France ( AP ) - The latest news related to the U.N. climate conference outside Paris , which runs through Dec. 11 . All times local : 10:30 p.m. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has presented a new draft of a global climate accord showing governments have made progress on some crunch issues but still disagree on others . The 27-page draft released late Thursday - two pages shorter than a previous version - suggested negotiators have settled on a long-term goal of keeping global warming `` well below '' 2 degrees Celsius ( 3.6 degrees F ) , while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C . The draft says governments `` aim to reach the peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible . '' Previous drafts included stronger options with more specific timeframes . The draft still contained competing options on the key issue of transparency - making sure countries follow through on their emissions targets . The text included an option asking for different rules for rich and poor countries , which the former have said is unacceptable . Negotiators were given two hours to review the draft and then to come back and continue the talks . `` I think , I hope that by the end of this night we 'll have a draft of the final text , '' Fabius said . `` We are much closer . '' 9:10 p.m. President Barack Obama and French President Francois Hollande ( frahn-SWAH ' oh-LAWND ' ) are reviewing what progress has been made toward completing a global climate agreement . Obama and Hollande spoke by phone on Thursday about the status of the talks . The White House says both leaders underscored their `` firm commitment '' to cooperating to reach an ambitious and sustainable pact . Negotiators have been struggling to narrow down a 29-page draft of the sweeping deal to try to slow global warming . But countries remain at odds on critical issues . The deadline to finish the deal is Friday , although the talks could be extended beyond the deadline . The White House says Obama also thanked Hollande for sending France 's aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf to help in the fight against the Islamic State group . 4:45 p.m. International migration officials want a global climate accord under discussion to address the growing risk of migration because of extreme weather . The director of the International Organization for Migration , William Lacy Swing , said the planet is seeing more forced migration today than any time since World War II , and seeing what he called `` unprecedented anti-immigration sentiment . '' `` If we add the effect of climate change ... you really have the elements of a perfect storm , '' he said on the sidelines of the Paris climate talks `` We are here ... to find out how to weather that storm . '' Jan Egeland , head of the Norwegian Refugee Council , said `` every second , a person is forced to flee because of an extreme weather event . '' At least 19.3 million people worldwide were driven from their homes by natural disasters last year , most related to weather events , according to the Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Center . 4:30 p.m. . The chief United Nations environment officer is still optimistic that a deal will be hammered out soon . `` We 're now down to some of the so-called red line issues , some of the defining issues in the convention that have to do with principles , '' said Achim Steiner , United Nations Environment Program director . '' I think the fact that we are now essentially left with maybe 3 or 4 issues that need to have a political compromise negotiated and formulated should give us courage and hope that we are actually moving to an agreement . '' Steiner said he thinks the final issue will be differentiation between rich and poor nations , calling it `` one of the defining principles of where the convention began its journey . '' Steiner said he is still hoping to end talks Friday night as the French have promised . 3:35 p.m. Europe 's top representative at U.N. climate talks has accused China of blocking proposals for countries to update their carbon pollution targets every five years , which he called critical for a deal in Paris . EU Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete told reporters Thursday `` without the five-year cycles , the agreement is meaningless . '' Canete said Chinese negotiators are opposed to making five-yearly updates a requirement in the agreement even though they agreed to such reviews before the Paris talks . More than 180 countries have presented emissions targets for after 2020 , when the envisioned deal is supposed to take effect . Scientific analyses show those targets wo n't be enough to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial times , the overarching goal of the climate talks . Canete says `` unless you come back every five years to update your targets , you can never reach the long-term goal . '' China , the world 's biggest carbon polluter , has pledged to peak its emissions `` by approximately 2030 or sooner . '' 3:05 p.m. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says he is `` reasonably optimistic '' that countries will reach a strong agreement to slow global warming at Paris talks scheduled to finish Friday . Ban met Thursday at the climate conference with former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and non-governmental organizations seeking a robust deal . Calling this a `` a very critical moment , '' Ban said `` I am hopeful and I 'm reasonably optimistic that we will be able to have for the first in the history of the United Nations a universal and very ambitious climate change agreement , which will make our human beings lives healthier and more prosperous . '' The last global accord on global warming , the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , only required rich countries to cut emissions . The climate change accord currently under negotiation would require all countries to pitch in . 2:10 p.m. Activists have a new way of trying to increase pressure on negotiators at the Paris climate talks - with caricatures of big-headed world leaders and piped-in voices from people around the world who want a robust agreement to fight global warming . Advocacy group Oxfam performed a skit Thursday at the talks with protesters wearing oversized `` big head '' masks representing world leaders . The big heads slept as an alarm clock rang , trying to rouse them to act to slow down climate change - but the heads stayed asleep . Nearby , a pyramid of boxes and speakers broadcast voices recorded by activist group Avaaz . A cacophony of languages and pleas resonated in an effort to remind negotiators of concerns of people from countries vulnerable to rising seas and increasingly extreme weather caused in part by man-made carbon emissions . Many activist groups want the Paris accord to call for an end to fossil fuel use in the long term and to back firm pledges by rich countries to help poor countries pay for future damages caused by climate change . 2 p.m. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry says Paris climate talks are `` getting down to the critical stage , '' as he meets negotiators from developing countries at the high-stakes conference . Meeting Indian Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar , Kerry said `` we need to work on language and that 's what most of today and tonight will be . '' He and Javadekar did n't elaborate on differences in their positions . Many sticking points remain among delegations over which countries should take the most responsibility for fighting man-made global warming . Javadekar said , `` We have discussed all issues and whatever the differing views on different positions and we are working toward ... because we want Paris to succeed . We want future generations to get a right and good deal from Paris and to that end we work , and I think today 's meeting was a productive meeting . '' Kerry is also meeting negotiators from Brazil and Malaysia on Thursday , and will meet later with talks host , French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius . 11:30 a.m. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is meeting with the environment ministers of two of the largest developing nations as negotiators try to hammer out details of a global accord on climate change by the end of the week . Kerry was holding talks at the Le Bourget conference site outside of Paris on Thursday with the environment ministers of Brazil and India , according to the State Department . No details of the meetings were immediately available but Brazil and India are among the biggest nations demanding that richer countries pay and do more to reduce carbon emissions . Kerry is expected to meet with numerous other negotiators who produced a 29-page draft agreement on Wednesday . Much more remains to be resolved to get a final deal by Friday 's self-imposed deadline . 11:05 a.m. Diplomats and climate negotiators worked almost until dawn and have now resumed talks , narrowing down options in a 29-page draft of a global accord to tackle climate change a day before a self-imposed deadline for the unprecedented agreement . A French diplomat said talks outside Paris continued until about 5 a.m. Thursday ( 0400 GMT , 11 p.m. EST Wednesday ) before resuming midmorning . The diplomat said a new draft of the accord is expected to be released sometime Thursday . He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was n't authorized to speak publicly about the negotiations . The French organizers of the two-week talks want a final agreement by Friday night , though U.N. climate conferences rarely end on time . The draft released Wednesday left major issues unresolved .

'' senate majority leader harry reid , a nevada democrat , called the early-morning vote `` a victory for the american people . '' his counterpart , republican leader mitch mcconnell , of kentucky , pledged to continue fighting a measure he said does n't solve the problem of skyrocketing health-care costs . `` my colleagues and i will work to stop this bill from becoming law , '' he said . the senate and house must now work together on a compromise between their two versions , a process that democrats want to finish before the president 's state of the union address in late january or early february . negotiations will center on the different tax proposals in each measure , provisions on abortion and a new government-run insurance program that 's included in the house bill and not the senate 's . the obama administration is aiming at completing a compromise around the time of the speech and before next year 's budget is presented to congress in early february , said an administration official speaking on condition of anonymity . reid and house speaker nancy pelosi of california plan to talk next week , and aides from both chambers will likely start working on the legislation during the first week of january , said reid 's spokesman jim manley . both bills represent the biggest expansion of health coverage since congress created the medicare program for the elderly in 1965 and would restructure a system that represents about 18 percent of the world 's largest economy . obama has linked the effort to curb rising medical costs to the long-term health of the u.s. economy . the senate 's passage follows a debate that dominated capitol hill for the year and was marked by partisan rancor . reid was forced to mend rifts within his own party that threatened to derail the measure . republicans rejected attempts by democrats to hold the vote on final passage earlier in the week . it was the first time the senate held a vote on christmas eve since 1895 , according to the senate press gallery . democrats paid tribute to the late senator ted kennedy , the massachusetts democrat who made health care a top priority during almost five decades in congress . his widow , victoria kennedy , was in the senate gallery for the vote and was hugging people , laughing and crying . `` as we stand at the finish line here in the senate , we are not alone , '' said senator max baucus , a montana democrat . `` we stand with those who have blazed the trail ahead of us , tireless champions of reform , such as our good friend ted kennedy . '' representative john dingell , a michigan democrat who is the longest-serving house member in history and who presided over house debate on medicare , also watched from the gallery . `` it is a major incremental step , '' dingell said of the vote . `` it 's a stride forward to meet a large unmet need . '' like a $ 1 trillion house bill passed on nov. 7 , the 10-year senate plan requires that americans get insurance or pay a penalty , while at the same time requiring insurers to accept all comers , regardless of preexisting conditions . it offers expanded government aid for the poor and sets up new online purchasing exchanges so the uninsured can shop for policies . minnetonka , minnesota-based unitedhealth group inc. and other health insurers would get millions of new customers , also a benefit for companies such as medical-device maker medtronic inc. of minneapolis and drugmaker pfizer inc. of new york . at the same time , their industries would face billions of dollars in new fees . health-insurer stocks rallied earlier this week after the senate bill cleared its first procedural hurdle . changes from an earlier version , including a one-year delay in the planned fees and the lack of a competing new government insurance program , or public option , boosted the shares . the 13-member s & p supercomposite managed health care index jumped 2.9 percent on dec. 21 . the index today was down 0.7 percent at 11:13 a.m. the s & p 500 pharmaceuticals index of 11 drugmakers was little changed , after rising more than 15 percent this year . republican senator olympia snowe of maine said the party - line vote reflected the intensely partisan and politicized atmosphere in washington . `` it 's a sad commentary that we ca n't create the kind of environment to create consensus , '' snowe said in an interview . `` it 's an unforgiving environment to craft consensus . '' obama and the democratic leadership worked hard to court snowe , who in october voted for the measure in the finance committee . there were days when she spoke to the president twice , she said . she had wanted more time to review the legislation before the final vote . senator joseph lieberman , a connecticut independent , said that as the house and senate bills are merged , there likely would be further attempts to make the measure more appealing to lawmakers with reservations . republicans expressed hope that they could stop the bill . `` we did everything we could to illuminate the flaws and problems with the rush to judgment , '' senator johnny isakson , a georgia republican , said in an interview . `` all of us want to improve access to health care and affordability , but we do n't want to break the bank .

'' the union 's members are expected to discuss the strike , the threat of which is centered on job protections for the union 's most senior members , at a meeting on tuesday . nonetheless , the city spared no effort to plan for the event , drawing up detailed rules , conditions and safeguards . field trips requiring yellow-bus service would be canceled , but after-school programs would continue . delays of up to two hours would be forgiven , and absences would be excused from students ' attendance records if they happened as a result of the strike . the city 's education department spent $ 1.3 million buying 300,000 metrocards to give to students who are picked up at bus stops and to parents whose children might need an escort to school because they are disabled or too young to ride the subway on their own . parents who drive will be reimbursed based on the number of miles traveled , while those who use another type of private transportation can turn in receipts for reimbursement . `` we are deeply concerned about the impact of a strike on your schools and school communities , '' mr. walcott wrote to principals . on friday , the city issued a request for bids for the transportation of roughly 14,000 preschool students who have special needs . unlike existing contracts governing the transportation of older students , the agreements with drivers of preschool students would not require new companies picked for the job to hire , by order of seniority and at the same rate of pay , bus drivers , matrons and other workers from the companies that lost the contracts . the specter of a strike is an interesting turn of events for mayor michael r. bloomberg . for years , his administration had fought alongside the union to keep the seniority-based protections in the contracts , in part because removing them could have prompted the union to strike . in july , however , the city made an about-face , asking gov. andrew m. cuomo to veto a bill it had helped develop that would have extended the protections to bus contracts for preschool students who receive special education services . mr. cuomo did just that in september , citing a decision by the state court of appeals that including such protections drives up cost and drives away competition . ( the protections are part of the contracts , which expire in december 2012 , that govern the transportation of about 138,000 students from kindergarten through 12th grade . ) in a news conference at city hall on friday , mr. bloomberg characterized a possible strike as `` illegal '' and the union 's behavior as `` outrageous '' based on the court ruling . he said the city had asked the national labor relations board for a ruling of unfair labor practice against the union , whose members are employed not by the city , but by private companies with which the city arranges contracts to provide transportation . in the meantime , a coalition representing the four largest school-transportation companies issued a statement , saying the companies would seek a court injunction to prevent a strike . `` we 're asking for cooler heads to prevail and for the drivers to stay on the job , '' carolyn daly , a spokeswoman for the coalition , said in an interview . most of the students who would be affected by the strike live in brooklyn and queens , some of them outside the city 's public transportation grid . about 102,000 of them are in elementary school ; of those , approximately 30,000 have special needs , and some of them require specific travel accommodations , limited travel time and door-to-door service . joe williams , who lives in crown heights , has a 12-year-old son who is picked up at home and taken to a school in bensonhurst , another brooklyn neighborhood a few miles away . mr. williams said it would be `` very selfish '' if the bus drivers were to strike , adding that the job protections they are demanding are `` a luxury they do n't want to give up .

South Korea said some North Korean officials returned to an inter-Korean liaison office on Monday , March 25 , 2019 , three days after the North abruptly withdrew its entire staff citing unspecified instructions from `` higher-level authorities . '' ( Korea Pool/Yonhap via AP , File ) SUB Facebook Twitter SMS Email Print Save SEOUL , South Korea ( AP ) -- South Korea said some North Korean officials returned to an inter-Korean liaison office on Monday , three days after the North abruptly withdrew its entire staff citing unspecified instructions from `` higher-level authorities . '' It was n't immediately clear why North Korea sent some workers back to the office or whether it would restore a full staff . The North 's decision to withdraw its staff on Friday came a week after its vice foreign minister threatened to pull out of nuclear negotiations with the United States following the collapse of a nuclear summit last month between leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump in Vietnam . Seoul 's Unification Ministry , which deals with inter-Korean affairs , said in a statement that four to five North Korean officials showed up for work Monday at the liaison office in the North Korean border town of Kaesong and told South Korean officials they came to work their usual shifts . The ministry said the North had still not provided a clear explanation as to why it withdrew staff from the office . It expressed hope that even the partial return of North Korean personnel would allow the office to serve its `` essential function . '' The North reportedly had sent about 10 workers each working day to the office since it opened last September as part of a slew of reconciliation steps between the rivals agreed to by Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in . `` We plan to continue operating the inter-Korean liaison office like we did in normal times , '' said Baik Tae-hyun , the ministry 's spokesman . Some analysts say the withdrawal was part of North Korean efforts to pressure South Korea to back its position with the United States more strongly following the breakdown of the Trump-Kim summit . North Korean state media have recently demanded that South Korea distance itself from the United States and resume joint economic projects that have been held back by U.S.-led sanctions against the North . The Koreas in past months have also dismantled some of their front-line guard posts , halted military exercises across their border and vowed to resume inter-Korean economic projects when possible , voicing optimism that international sanctions could end , allowing such projects . While Moon says inter-Korean reconciliation is crucial for achieving progress in nuclear negotiations , the breakdown of the Trump-Kim summit has created a difficult environment to push engagement with the North . Washington and Pyongyang have struggled with the sequencing of North Korea 's nuclear disarmament and the removal of sanctions , and blamed each other for the collapse of last month 's meeting in Hanoi . The liaison office between the Koreas is the first since the Korean Peninsula was split into a U.S.-backed capitalistic South and a Soviet-supported socialist North in 1945 . The rivals previously used telephone and fax-like communication channels that were often shut down in times of high tensions . Kaesong is also the location of a now-shuttered factory complex that was jointly run by the two Koreas . It combined South Korean capital and technology with cheap North Korean labor . Both Koreas want the United States to allow exemptions from the sanctions to permit the reopening of the factory park , which provided North Korea with much-needed foreign currency . Critics say Kaesong and other inter-Korean economic projects helped North Korea fund its nuclear weapons program . Copyright 2019 The Associated Press . All rights reserved .

It is with pain that I have learned of the protest demonstrations of the past days that were met with a harsh response , causing tens of victims , '' Francis said at his weekly Sunday blessing and message . Iraqi security forces have used live ammunition , tear gas and stun grenades against protesters and last week saw some of the bloodiest incidents since the demonstrations began , with scores of people killed particularly in the southern cities of Nassiriya and Najaf . Subscribe on Telegram to get latest news from Middle East Francis , who has said he wants to visit Iraq next year , told tens of thousands of people in St. Peter 's Square that he was praying for the dead and wounded and invoking God for peace in the country . The unrest , which has killed mostly demonstrators , amounts to the biggest challenge for Iraq since Islamic State insurgents seized vast swathes of Iraqi and Syrian territory in 2014 . It pits mostly young , disaffected Shi'ite protesters against a Shi'ite - dominated government backed by Iran and accused of squandering Iraq 's oil wealth while infrastructure and living standards deteriorate .

Sinfield added : `` David was an outstanding candidate to be our head coach and was my first choice for the job . `` Unfortunately , we have not started the season as we had all hoped and action was needed to move in a fresh direction with this group of players this season . `` I would like to thank David for his commitment to the club especially the sacrifices he made to travel from his home in Australia to take up our challenge .

'' the measure contains budget increases , on average , of 8 percent for the domestic agencies it covers , far more than they received under the bush administration . but moderate democrats are unhappy with the additional spending , especially after many agencies received huge infusions of money under the just-enacted economic recovery bill . `` it 's become increasingly clear that most of our democrat [ sic ] colleagues here in congress - senator bayh notwithstanding - are perfectly comfortable with the breathtaking rate of spending we 've been on since the beginning of the year , '' said senate minority leader mitch mcconnell , r-ky . `` they want it to continue , without restraint and without any end in sight . '' at the same time , democratic sens. robert menendez of new jersey and bill nelson of florida are weighing whether to oppose the legislation over a provision buried in it that would moderate rules on travel to cuba and would make it easier for cuba to pay for imports of food and medicine . it 's not clear whether the pockets of opposition are enough to sink the measure , which would fund 12 cabinet departments and other agencies for the ongoing budget year . democratic leaders hope to clear the bill - which passed the house last week - to meet a friday deadline . that 's when a stopgap funding law that keeps the government going , mostly at 2008 levels , runs out . senate majority leader harry reid , d-nev. , is also trying to keep the bill free of floor amendments that would force the measure into negotiations with the house that would delay enactment . but that means democrats will have to cast some politically difficult votes . one of the most uncomfortable could come wednesday on an amendment by tom coburn , r-okla. , to kill 13 so-called earmarks requested by lawmakers for projects sought by pma group , a lobbying company at the center of a federal corruption investigation . the pma group , which recently folded , had a reputation for funneling campaign money to lawmakers that obtained earmarks for its clients and is under investigation by the justice department over whether the company reimbursed some employees for campaign contributions to members of congress who requested the projects . on cuba , menendez is upset by a provision that would restore travel rules permitting people to visit relatives in cuba once every 12 months . president george w. bush imposed rules in 2004 that limited travel to just two weeks every three years and confined visits to immediate family members . the omnibus bill also would lift restrictions on financing imports of u.s. food and medicine into cuba and effectively reverse bush administration rules requiring `` cash-in-advance '' payment . `` if the omnibus bill is signed by the president as is , he will be extending a hand while the castro regime maintains its iron-handed clenched fist , '' menendez said monday . the underlying legislation will need at least a few gop votes to clear a key legislative hurdle later this week . sen. thad cochran , r-miss. , the appropriations committee 's top republican , is the only republican so far to publicly announce support for the bill , though other old-school gop panel members are likely to help the bill along -

'' raye himself said he plans on being back for 2010 . based on league rankings , though , it 's hard to see how he has distinguished himself from his replaceable predecessors . entering today 's game against the detroit lions at candlestick park , the 49ers are 28th in the nfl in yards per game . the 49ers are also bottom-feeders when it comes to converting on third down , at just 30 percent . among 49ers coordinators since 2003 , only mike mccarthy ( 24 percent in 2004 ) fared worse . so why not change play-callers again ? 49ers quarterbacks coach mike johnson , 42 , in his ninth year as an assistant , is considered a coordinator-in-waiting . singletary was asked recently if the long-term plan involved promoting johnson to offensive coordinator . plan right now and stay focused on that before i talk about long-term plans , '' singletary responded . until then , the 49ers remain publicly committed to raye . indeed , not all the of the 49ers ' statistics this season are bleak . they rank seventh in red-zone efficiency , meaning they are making the most of their rare scoring chances . tight end vernon davis ( 11 touchdowns ) and running back frank gore ( 10 ) are the first 49ers teammates with double-digit td totals since terrell owens and charlie garner in 2000 . `` since i 've been here , i have n't really had the opportunity to show what i could do , '' davis said . `` but now that jimmy raye has come in , he 's given me a lot more opportunity to make plays . '' the 49ers average 20.1 points per game , which ranks 18th in the league , and though that might not seem like much , it marks the first time they have ranked in the top 20 since 2003 . raye 's supporters point out his ability to orchestrate an offensive overhaul midstream . singletary originally ordered up a conservative offense led by gore . but gore 's ankle injury , a quarterback change from shaun hill to alex smith , the late addition of receiver michael crabtree and the emergence of davis prompted the 49ers to re-evaluate . in the blink of an eye , they became a shotgun-passing attack . over one three-game period starting nov. 22 , the 49ers ran just 42 times - the lowest number of rushes over a three-game stretch in 49ers history , according to elias sports bureau . `` i think that jimmy has adapted and adjusted , '' singletary said . `` anything that i 've asked him to do , he 's been more than willing to do , and i think that he 's done a fine job . `` i think that alex has adjusted to him well . i think that he ( jimmy ) and alex are on the same page . '' still , raye is putting up essentially the same numbers that got mike martz fired as offensive coordinator a year ago . martz averaged 311.1 yards and 21.2 points . raye averages 286.6 yards and 20.1 points . and for all the early talk about establishing a running game , only two recent 49ers coordinators have fared worse than raye 's 99.4-yard average on the ground . jim hostler averaged 92.3 yards ( 2006 ) , and ted tollner managed just 90.6 ( 2004 ) . york has indicated that the best way for the 49ers to get out of their skid is n't to have more change . it 's to have less . he said he plans to keep the same management team in place for 2010 , including singletary and general manager scot mccloughan . york said the ultimate call on the offensive coordinator belongs to singletary . but in general , the 49ers think that keeping the same quarterback in the same system with the same supporting cast could lead to a long-awaited breakthrough . `` i think it 's very important to have continuity . i think ( singletary ) has talked about the great job that jimmy has done , '' york said . `` it 's a process , it 's not something that happens overnight . i think you are starting to see the offense come together a little bit .

'' the black book - empowering black families and communities is self-published by brown . it outlines principles to bring about a revolution in the black community and , according to court documents , is being distributed throughout the state . an online order form offers a discount for inmates . bundley said he met brown , a 40-year-old from baltimore incarcerated since 1992 on drug charges , while doing gang outreach work in the state 's prison system . he said he was impressed with brown 's work helping soon-to-be-released felons of various gang affiliations with self-improvement as they prepared for life in the outside world . those lessons were eventually compiled in the black book , bundley said , and his quotes apply only to the self-improvement work he witnessed personally . he said he was in no way condoning the violence with which the gang has been associated . school officials questioned bundley this week after learning of his quotes in the book . bundley 's own book is cited in the black book among works by such notable figures as marcus garvey , according to a copy obtained by the baltimore sun . . `` i 've seen [ rival gangs ] come together in one room and work on the lessons in the black book to get themselves together , '' bundley told the baltimore sun . `` i know eric brown was a major player inside the prison doing that work . the quote on the back of the book is only about the work that i witnessed : no more , no less .

In addition , it is linked to increased cardiovascular disease risk and mortality , high blood pressure , harmful cholesterol levels and fatty liver disease . Cardiometabolic syndrome ( CMS ) is a cluster of conditions that increase a person 's risk of heart disease , stroke and diabetes . These conditions include high blood pressure , high blood sugar , excess body fat around the waist and abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels . `` Our goal was to discover new factors produced by the cells in fat tissue that have an impact on cardiometabolic disease . In particular , we wanted to identify those important to maintaining the framework of fat tissue , called the extracellular matrix , which becomes dysfunctional in obesity , '' said David Bradley , Assistant Professor at The Ohio State University in the US . For the study , the team included a small group of 54 obese and 18 lean patients . The findings , published in the journal , Diabetes Care , showed that clusterin , which is overproduced from the fat cells of obese patients , is strongly related to insulin resistance , said the study . Insulin resistance is a major cause of Type-2 Diabetes , and patients with obesity commonly have both metabolic and cardiovascular complications . `` Fat cells increase clusterin production as they enlarge in obesity . Clusterin may be a biomarker of disease , as well as a therapeutic target to potentially prevent this disease , '' said lead researcher Willa Hsueh , Professor at the varsity . `` This collaborative research is shedding new light on the importance of clusterin on ` cardiometabolic syndrome ' , which may eventually lead to developing new treatments for this life-threatening combination of diabetes , high blood pressure and obesity , '' said K. Craig Kent , dean at the varsity . CMS , which affects about 25 per cent of the world 's population , is now recognised as a disease entity by the World Health Organization and the American Society of Endocrinology . Further translational research involving mouse models is needed to learn more about how clusterin impacts each of the CMS components and whether administrating clusterin-inhibiting antibodies inhibits CMS , the study noted .

While 36.2 lakh of the 40.07 lakh NRC applicants whose names did not figure in the complete draft NRC have claimed to be Indians , there have been objections against the inclusion of around two lakh of the 2.89 crore names that figured in the draft . The claimants , objectors and against whose inclusion there are objections are being called with 15-day prior notices to appear before NRC hearing centres across the State . The hearing centres are manned by some 3,457 hearing officers . Going by the Supreme Court-approved SOP ( Standard Operating Procedure ) , the biometric data of the claimants and the applicants against whose inclusion there are objections are to be collected by the State Government , not by the NRC authority . The collection of biometric data looks like an elephantine task . To get the job done at ease , the State government is going to use the existing biometric data collection setups meant for AADHAR cards . The 1,241 AADHAR enrollment centres working in the State now have been converted into biometric data collection centres for NRC . Such centres are being shifted to NRC hearing centres . During this period , the thrust is on biometric data collection for NRC , not for AADHAR enrollment . If the names of those whose biometric data will be collected appear in the final NRC , their AADHAR cards will be automatically ready . If their names do not figure in the final NRC the question of issuing them AADHAR card does not arise . UIDAI ( Unique Identification Authority of India ) has helped Assam in this job . Those who have already got AADHAR cards need not give biometric data for NRC anymore . They will have to show their AADHAR cards and give ID numbers to the NRC authority . The apex court has ordered that the publication of final NRC can not go beyond July 31 , 2019 and that the forthcoming Lok Sabha election should not affect NRC update exercise . The NRC update work began in mid-2015 . As many as 3.29 crore people applied for inclusion of their names in NRC .

'' the contributions also have come from unexpected sources . ryan vogelsong has gone from filling in for the injured barry zito to leading an already stellar rotation with a 1.81 era and 4-1 record . midseason call-up brandon crawford has given san francisco another power-hitting lefty , and the bullpen only seems to be getting stronger . the starting pitching has still been the biggest reason why the giants are in first place . while ace tim lincecum has struggled since a three-hit masterpiece may 21 , rotation regulars matt cain , madison bumgarner and jonathan sanchez have given a banged-up offense a healthy dose of pitching . so far , that has been just good enough . `` to be in first place , we know that means nothing now , and we understand that , '' bochy said . `` but with all the injuries and losses , it shows the resiliency of the club .

AP Photo/University of Indianapolis , Guy Housewright June 25 : A marker with `` John Doe '' marked the grave of an unidentified immigrant at a cemetery in Falfurrias , Texas . The mass graves of suspected unidentified immigrants buried haphazardly in a South Texas cemetery and uncovered this month by anthropologists should be secured by state police until a criminal investigation can be carried out , a Texas lawmaker said Sunday . State Rep. Terry Canales , D-Edinburg , said he had asked the Department of Public Safety to secure the cemetery in Falfurrias following revelations of human remains buried in garbage bags and multiple remains put in a single body bag without proper records . DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said Sunday in an email that , `` the Texas Rangers plan to meet with local officials Monday to determine the proper course of action . '' ADVERTISEMENT Baylor University anthropologist Lori Baker and Krista Latham , a forensic anthropologist at the University of Indianapolis , worked with their students at the cemetery this month in an ongoing project to identify immigrant remains along the U.S.-Mexico border . The teams worked in Falfurrias last year as well and found similar practices . `` There 's no question in one way or another that this is illegal , whether it violates the actual penal code or it if constitutes fraud , '' Canales said . The remains were buried by the Funeraria del Angel Howard-Williams , which has offices in Falfurrias and Hebbronville , Baker said Friday . Both Brooks and Jim Hogg counties contracted with the funeral home to bury unidentified remains there . `` This is not a respectful way of interring someone 's remains , '' Baker said . `` And we had one , of course , with all of these bags on top of bags this year and not in a coffin . Most of these remains were not within a coffin , they were buried just in the body bags or whatever else they were recovered in . '' 52 graves this month , but will not know how many individuals they have until they are inventoried at the lab . A message left at Howard-Williams over the weekend was not returned . The funeral home 's Houston-based parent company , Service Corp. . International , did not immediately respond to an email message Sunday . Service Corp. . International told the Caller-Times in a statement , `` No matter if this is one of our client families we serve on a traditional basis or a migrant family 's loved one we 're serving and we do n't have any identification of the loved one , I do want to let you know it is our policy to treat the decedent with care , to treat them just like we would treat anyone else .

feeding their innovation pipeline and keeping products in development and production rather than let those small companies fail . on the other side of the equation , there is a need to push more care outside of the expensive acute care setting . there is a need to create organizations that have economies of scale and scope to invest in more supply chain expertise . single-owned hospitals will continue to struggle for profitability . globalization - the changing tide of healthcare is washing across the globe . reform is often debated as a u.s.-only initiative , but it 's not . it 's critical that the industry address how to drive more efficient care globally . the ability to deliver cost-efficient , quality care is a universal issue . standardization - the drive continues toward greater standardization . this will be foundational , based on more effective automation and more effective data-sharing . data synchronization and standardization , and regulations such as unique device identification will become increasingly important . about ghx global healthcare exchange , llc ( ghx ) makes healthcare more efficient by delivering software and services that enable both healthcare providers and suppliers to increase efficiency , lower costs and deliver better patient care . with the largest footprint in healthcare supply chain management , ghx connects more than 80 percent of licensed hospital beds at u.s. hospitals , as well as providers in canada and europe , with the suppliers from which they purchase the majority of their medical-surgical supplies . ghx is transforming today 's linear healthcare supply chain into the industry 's only healthcare supply cloud , providing 360-degree visibility into areas affecting both clinical and financial performance . working with ghx , organizations can improve business processes , automate supply chain systems and work together in a collaborative environment to solve the tough challenges facing healthcare today . ghx is owned by members of the healthcare industry , including abbott exchange , inc. ; amerisourcebergen corp. ; baxter healthcare corp. ; b. braun medical inc. ; bd ; boston scientific corp. ; cardinal health , inc. ; covidien ; c.r. bard , inc. ; thermo fisher scientific inc. ; ge healthcare ; hca ; johnson & johnson health care systems inc. ; mckesson corp. ; medtronic usa , inc. ; owens & minor ; premier , inc. ; siemens ; university healthsystem consortium ; and vha inc. for more information , visit www.ghx.com . source ghx", "date": "2011-01-18 14:02:15", "url": "http://earthtimes.org/articles/press/supply-chain-savings-2010,1618023.html", "phase": "C", "title": "partnering with ghx , healthcare providers and suppliers achieved more than $ 730 million in supply chain savings in 2010", "names": [{"name": "bruce johnson", "ids": ["Q16269599", "Q18585998", "Q4977745", "Q4977748", "Q4977749", "Q4977751", "Q4977752"], "offsets": [[348, 350], [384, 385], [462, 463], [1010, 1011], [1012, 1013]]}]}, {"articleID": "2009122311_00045298_W", "content": "the christmas break has come at exactly the right time for otley . that 's the verdict of director of rugby gary walker , with his side carrying a few walking wounded after not having the best of injury runs in the past month . the cross greeners have been without a full deck of players for several weeks , with their advertisement woes exacerbated in a gruelling clash at newbury on saturday which saw them edged out 20-14 in national one . two second-half tries did the damage but while the reverse inflicted a sixth league defeat in seven upon fourth-bottom otley , walker insists his fledgling side have plenty to look forward to in the second half of the season . especially when they get several players back , with otley returning to action at tynedale on january 2 . walker said : `` we are young , it 's national division rugby and it 's certainly quite tough . two weeks off will be good for the players . hopefully , we 'll get a few players back soon . alex ball , our second row who has been out for a few weeks now , could be back - probably not for tynedale , but certainly for wharfedale the week after . `` the break should enable us to get back to reasonably full strength . rob whatmuff might be back for the tynedale game in the centre as well . `` we have got 27 points at the moment , so we are not far off where we thought we would be . our run-in is eight at home and six away and we 've played cambridge and esher at home already , so we 'd like to think we 'll get more points in the second half of the season .

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid April 23 , 2019 By Simon Jessop and Ludwig Burger LONDON/FRANKFURT ( Reuters ) -- Bayer 's largest shareholder , fund manager BlackRock , will not support the German company 's management in a key vote at its annual general meeting ( AGM ) on Friday , two people familiar with the situation told Reuters . About 30 billion euros ( $ 34 billion ) has been wiped off the pesticides and drugs firm 's market value since August , when a U.S. jury found Bayer liable because Monsanto , which it bought for $ 63 billion last year , had not warned of alleged cancer risks linked to its weedkiller Roundup . Bayer suffered a similar courtroom defeat last month and more than 11,000 plaintiffs are claiming damages . BlackRock , which latest filings show owns 7.2 percent of Bayer 's voting rights , plans to either abstain from or vote against ratifying the management board 's actions during the year under review , the sources said . The largely symbolic vote of confidence `` will send a message to the board '' that BlackRock is not happy with the way Bayer 's management handled the Monsanto deal , one of the sources said . Recent defeats in U.S. courts , which Bayer is appealing , have shed a new light on Bayer 's assessment of the legal risks it took with the Monsanto deal , the source added . A vote to ratify the board 's actions features prominently at every German AGM . It has no bearing on management 's liability , but is seen as a key gauge of shareholder sentiment . Bayer 's management , led by CEO Werner Baumann , could see an embarrassing plunge in approval ratings , down from 97 percent at last year 's AGM https://www.investor.bayer.de/en/events/stockholders-meeting/asm-2018 , which was held shortly before the Monsanto takeover was closed in June . Asset management firm Deka , among Bayer 's largest German investors , said over the weekend it would vote against ratifying management 's action , having voiced sharp criticism earlier this month . Also this month , shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services ( ISS ) and Glass Lewis recommended investors not to give the executive board their seal of approval . Singapore state investor Temasek and Norway 's oil fund , Bayer 's next two biggest shareholders after BlackRock , both declined to comment on their voting intentions . Major Frankfurt-based asset managers DWS and Union Investment also would not disclose their plans . Approval ratings of more than 95 percent have long been the norm at German AGMs but international investors have become more critical over recent years . In a recent low for a company leadership team , former Deutsche Bank co-CEOs Anshu Jain and Juergen Fitschen scored approval ratings of 61 percent during the bank 's 2015 AGM . Both announced their resignation within weeks . Company filings showed this month that Bayer 's supervisory board sought law firm Linklaters ' expert opinion for reassurance that management had complied with its duties when acquiring Monsanto . Non-executive Chairman Werner Wenning has come out in strong support of the top executive team and its decision to pursue the Monsanto deal . Sources have said the Wenning himself was a driving force behind the transaction . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , the European Chemicals Agency and other regulators across the globe have found that glyphosate , the active ingredient in Roundup , is not likely carcinogenic to humans . However , the World Health Organization 's cancer arm in 2015 reached a different conclusion , classifying glyphosate as `` probably carcinogenic to humans .

In the 12 months to August 3 , allegations of sexual offences to Lincolnshire Police increased by 24 per cent - from 232 to 287 . These include a 60 per cent rise in reported rape , from 55 to 88 , and a 12 per cent hike in other sexual assaults , from 177 to 199 . Although the police are not sure how many of the reports are of historic sex crimes from several years ago , they believe calls about these have led to much of the increase . Portland Street unexplained death : Community rallies together after Eastern European woman 's death Portland Street unexplained death : Police go door to door after woman 's death Decision over arrest of former Lincoln Priory Federation of Academies boss Richard Gilliland due next week And they say high-profile convictions secured by officers conducting Operation Yewtree - which have led to the convictions recently of Rolf Harris and Max Clifford - are the reason why more victims are now speaking out . Detective Inspector Guy Leach , of Lincolnshire Police , said : `` In line with the rest of the country , we have seen a rise in reporting of historic sexual abuse . `` This follows the high profile cases investigated under Operation Yewtree and reported extensively in the national media . `` We treat an historic report as we would a report of recent abuse and we investigate accordingly , if that is in line with what the victim wants . `` In some cases , victims just want us to be aware should there be further reports against the suspect . '' Police say that the surge does not mean that more sex offences are occurring - but that more people are now feeling brave enough to come forward . And they are stressing that there are several groups in the county that can offer help to people who need it . Amanda Farquhar , manager of Lincoln 's Spring Lodge sexual assault referral centre , said : `` What we do know is there has been a definite increase in people coming forward to the police or asking for help . `` People are ringing us and walking through the door because of what they have seen in the media . `` We give them the facts and give them breathing space to come to a decision . If they ask us questions , we give them the facts and explain the legal process , should they decide to go down that route . `` If they choose not to go down the legal route , we can help them with counselling and emotional support . It is a case of listening to them and not judging . '' After the publicist Max Clifford was recently sentenced to eight years behind bars for a string of sexual assaults , Rape Crisis England and Wales says victims must be fully supported , no matter how old the allegation . Spokeswoman Katie Russell said : `` This case is a reminder of how important it is to allow the independent Crown Prosecution Service to pursue sexual offences through the courts where there is sufficient evidence to do so , no matter how long ago events took place and no matter who the alleged perpetrator might be . `` There are organisations that we work closely with and recommend to people reporting abuse , '' DI Leach said . `` Spring Lodge is the Sexual Assault Referrals Centre for Lincolnshire . They can help victims who have experienced abuse at any point in their lives . `` They offer help , support and advice regardless of whether the victim would like any police involvement .

The news and stories that matter , delivered weekday mornings . SUBSCRIBE Minutes before the planned execution of Alabama death row inmate Nathaniel Woods , the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily halted the move to further review his case . Nathaniel Woods , 44 , who was convicted for his role in the fatal shootings of three Birmingham police officers in 2004 , was set to die by lethal injection at 6 p.m. in Holman Prison -- the first execution in the state this year . It was unclear how long the high court 's stay of execution would last . Woods ' family and prominent activists have been rallying on his behalf , collecting signatures in hopes of swaying Gov. Kay Ivey . Renewed questions surrounding his trial , accusations that his case was mishandled and larger concerns over how Alabama 's criminal laws treat black defendants have caused concern in recent days . Nathaniel Woods sits in a courtroom during a preliminary hearing in Birmingham , Ala. , on July 30 , 2004 . Mark Almond / Birmingham News via AP file Even Woods ' co-defendant , Kerry Spencer , who has confessed to being the triggerman and denies Woods was complicit , implored for his execution to be stopped . `` Nathaniel Woods is 100 % innocent , '' Spencer , who remains on death row , wrote in an open letter . `` I know that to be a fact because I 'm the person that shot and killed all three of the officers that Nathaniel was subsequently charged and convicted of murdering . Nathaniel Woods does n't even deserve to be incarcerated , much less executed . '' The case drew attention from celebrities and activists , including Kim Kardashian West and Martin Luther King III , asking Ivey to intervene . The Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning 's top stories . Sign Up During Woods ' 2005 trial , prosecutors said he and his roommate , Spencer , were involved in the sale of crack cocaine from their Birmingham home . Officers were sent to the home to serve a misdemeanor warrant , but prosecutors said Woods , who was 27 at the time , set up an ambush that allowed Spencer to shoot at them multiple times . Three officers -- Carlos Owen , Harley Chisholm III and Charles Bennett -- were killed , while a fourth officer at the scene was shot but survived . Spencer admitted to shooting the officers , but said it was in self-defense because the officers were assaulting Woods , an assertion that the judge did not permit at trial . Two of the officers who were killed were later accused by another drug dealer at Woods ' home of being involved in a corrupt scheme that protected dealers in exchange for money . The Birmingham police declined to comment on the allegation . The surviving officer , Michael Collins , said at the time that he believed Woods helped plan the shooting , but that he did n't actually fire a weapon . According to him , Woods yelled , `` I give up . I give up . Just do n't spray me with that mace , '' before the shooting initiated . Collins added that `` I knew it was n't Nathaniel '' who had fired at him . While prosecutors did n't dispute that Spencer shot at the officers , Woods was tagged as an accomplice , which in Alabama means that even if a person did n't pull the trigger , they are still eligible for the death penalty . In addition , Alabama remains the only state in the nation in which a jury does n't have to be unanimous to impose the death penalty and can still enact it with at least 10 jurors in favor . While Spencer is on death row after he was convicted of murder , no execution date has been set . Supporters of Woods have said he was the victim of incompetent counsel who failed to conduct an adequate investigation and missed key deadlines for appeals . Woods could have benefited from a plea deal of 20 to 25 years in prison , but supporters said he was wrongly informed by his own attorneys that he would n't be convicted of capital murder because the state needed to prove he pulled the trigger . `` Mr. Woods did not accept this plea deal because he thought -- with counsel 's encouragement -- that he would be acquitted of these charges because the evidence would prove that he was not the shooter that day , '' according to a petition objecting to his imprisonment . In addition , supporters said , no evidence was produced that showed Woods plotted with Spencer and that it was Spencer who acted impulsively on his own when he opened fire . Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said in a statement Wednesday that the concerted effort by supporters is a `` last-minute movement ... to ` save ' cop-killer Nathaniel Woods from his just punishment .
